```{r options, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE)
```

I think I have all the data I need to run the productivity ~ diet models. So here goes...

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Import conflict settings.
source('../src/conflicted.R')

# Load some libraries.
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(vegan)
library(broom.mixed)
library(lme4)
library(purrr)
library(modelr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Make a little function for checking at random rows.
grab.some <- function(df, n=10) {
  index <- sample(1:nrow(df), n)
  df[index,]
}

# Bring in camera data.
new.data <- read_csv('../data/interim/cameras_20210315.csv', guess_max=7000) %>% 
  ## filter only records with at least size assigned...
  filter(size != 'U')

grab.some(new.data)
```

And also for the old data set.

```{r message=FALSE}
old.data <- read_csv('../data/interim/camera_corrected.csv', guess_max=7000) %>% 
  filter(size != 'Unknown')

grab.some(old.data)
```

How many photos?

```{r}
nrow(new.data)
nrow(old.data)
```

This doesn't make any sense at all. How many photos, in the new data set, from 2019 alone? This should match the old data set.

```{r}
new.data %>% filter(year(datetime) == 2019) %>% nrow()
```

So, somehow, my new data set is missing 6 photos from 2019. But even more confusing is that the output of `prey_attributes_revised` (as seen in "wtf") has 703 camera photos.

Here's what happens in `prey_attributes_revised`.

```{r message=FALSE}
camera.data.2019 <- read_csv('../data/interim/camera_corrected.csv', guess_max=7000) %>% 
  drop_na(class) %>% 
  select(site, datetime, class, family, genus, species, common, size) %>% 
  mutate(year=year(datetime), nest=paste(site, year, sep=''))

nrow(camera.data.2019)
```
This has dropped rows with no class specified (ie, neither Aves, Mammalia, or Unknown) but still keeps rows with a U for size. That's next...

```{r}
# Filter only items that at least have a size assigned...
camera.data.2019 <- camera.data.2019 %>% filter(size != 'Unknown') %>%
  select(site, year, nest, everything(), -datetime)

nrow(camera.data.2019)  
```

There's the same number I have above (which is weirdly 6 more than I had for the 2019 from the new dataset). Can I find the difference?

```{r}
new.data.2019 <- filter(new.data, year(datetime) == 2019)

anti_join(old.data, new.data.2019, by=c('filename', 'serial', 'datetime'))
```

All from TMC, and all late in the season... this implies I might have missed a datasheet. That's a fairly small issue I can come back to later.

Here's the rest of the old code:

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Bring in a list of all known prey.
prey.list <- read_csv('../data/interim/prey_attributes.csv')


# Fill in order based on family...
camera.data.2019 <- prey.list %>% select(order, family) %>% 
  right_join(camera.data.2019, by='family') %>% 
  
  ## then reorder columns so everything is pretty...
  select(site, nest, class, everything()) %>% 
  
  ## and fill in NAs in Order column with "Unknown"...
  replace_na(list(order = 'Unknown')) %>% 
  
  ## and finally add a marker for method.
  mutate(method='camera',
         source='C')

nrow(camera.data.2019)
```

Whoa! Ok, that just jumped by 362 items!! What the hell happened?!

Ahhhh, I think I did the join wrong. So this appears that the 703 items I found in the 'wtf' notebook are *completely wrong* and due to a code error. I have the exact same number of files, and the identical files, for 2019 as I did previously (barring 6 that are missing from TMC). I don't think there's any point continuing to walk through this old code, it's obviously deeply fucked up.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# To make sure the average sizes work, I also need to bring in the physical remains.
remains.data <- read_csv('../data/raw/20210118_specimens.csv', guess_max=7000) %>% 
  ## filter only records with at least size assigned...
  filter(size != 'U') %>% 
  ## and rename a confusing column.
  rename(name=site) %>% 
  ## and fix a typo
  mutate(genus=case_when(
    genus == 'Picoides' ~ 'Dryobates',
    TRUE ~ genus
  ))

# Bring in a list of site abbreviations and site names.
nest.list <- read_csv('../data/processed/site_abbreviations.csv')

# Standardize the specimen data.
remains.data <- left_join(remains.data, nest.list, by='name') %>% 
  filter(id != 1120) %>% 
  filter(id != 1171) %>% 
  filter(site != 'COM') %>% 
  select(site, date, class, order, family, genus, species, common, size, age, source)

# Standardize the camera data.
camera.data <- new.data %>% 
  mutate(date=date(datetime), source='C') %>% 
  select(site, date, class, order, family, genus, species, common, size, age, source)

# Join them together.
diet.data <- bind_rows(remains.data, camera.data)

# Add a unique site/year identifier.
diet.data <- diet.data %>% 
  mutate(year=year(date), nest=paste(site, year, sep=''))

# Do some cleanup.
diet.data <- diet.data %>% 
  mutate(size=case_when(
    size %in% c('S', 'Small') ~ 'small',
    size %in% c('M', 'Medium') ~ 'medium',
    size %in% c('L', 'Large') ~ 'large'
  )) %>%  
  ## and replace all the "U"s with "Unknown"...
  mutate_at(c('class', 'order', 'family', 'genus'), funs(case_when(
    . == 'U' ~ 'Unknown',
    TRUE ~ .
  ))) %>% 
  ## in species as well...
  mutate(species=case_when(
    species == 'U' ~ 'unknown',
    TRUE ~ species
  ))

grab.some(diet.data)
```

Let's summarize what's here so far.

```{r message=FALSE}
# Basic sample size numbers.
diet.data %>% group_by(year, source) %>% summarize(n=n()) %>% arrange(source)
```

That seems reasonable.

```{r}
options(knitr.kable.NA = '-')
diet.data %>% group_by(source, class, order, family, genus, species, common) %>% 
  summarize(n=n()) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=source, values_from=n) %>% 
  arrange(class, order, family, genus, species, common) %>% 
  kable() %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options='striped')
```

What this is clearly showing me is that I need to go back through and fix my specimen data... there's no point in a *Catharus sp.* when swainson's thrush is really the only option (wood thrush being v uncommon). The unknown ducks should be all the same. Etc. But the camera data seems fine.

Next we add biomass data.

```{r}
# Join the biomass data to the list of diet items.
diet.items <- prey.list %>% select(genus, species, binomial, common, category, mass) %>% 
  right_join(diet.data, by=c('genus', 'species', 'common'))

# For unidentified items, classify them by size and class.
diet.items <- diet.items %>% mutate(category=case_when(
  is.na(category) & class == 'Mammalia' & size == 'small' ~ 'small mammal',
  is.na(category) & class == 'Mammalia' & size == 'medium' ~ 'medium mammal',
  is.na(category) & class == 'Mammalia' & size == 'large' ~ 'large mammal',
  is.na(category) & class == 'Aves' & size == 'small' ~ 'small bird',
  is.na(category) & class == 'Aves' & size == 'medium' ~ 'medium bird',
  is.na(category) & class == 'Aves' & size == 'large' ~ 'large bird',
  is.na(category) & class == 'Unknown' ~ paste(size, 'item'),
  TRUE ~ category))

# For unidentified items, fill in the binomial column.
diet.items <- diet.items %>% replace_na(list(binomial = 'Unidentified item'))

# Calculate average masses for unidentified items, based of known species.
mean.mass <- diet.items %>% drop_na(mass) %>% 
  distinct(binomial, mass, category) %>% 
  group_by(category) %>% 
  ## averaging the mass for each size & class category...
  summarize(average=mean(mass)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=category, values_from=average) %>% 
  ## calculating the average mass for complete unknowns...
  mutate(`large item` = mean(`large bird`, `large mammal`),
         `medium item` = mean(`medium bird`, `medium mammal`),
         `small item` = mean(`small bird`, `small mammal`)) %>% 
  ## and reassembling it in a tidy format.
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to='category', values_to='average')

# Check the mean mass.
mean.mass
```

Now here's a question, why are the mass of small birds and small items the same? Actually, none of those averages worked!

Ah, I coded my averages wrong. This works:

```{r}
mean.mass <- diet.items %>% drop_na(mass) %>% 
  distinct(binomial, mass, category) %>% 
  group_by(category) %>% 
  ## averaging the mass for each size & class category...
  summarize(average=mean(mass)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=category, values_from=average) %>% 
  ## calculating the average mass for complete unknowns...
  mutate(`large item` = mean(c(`large bird`, `large mammal`)),
         `medium item` = mean(c(`medium bird`, `medium mammal`)),
         `small item` = mean(c(`small bird`, `small mammal`))) %>% 
  ## and reassembling it in a tidy format.
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to='category', values_to='average')

mean.mass
```

Then join things together and check again.

```{r}
# Join average mass to diet items...
diet.items <- left_join(diet.items, mean.mass, by='category') %>% 
  ## and fill in missing mass with average values
  mutate(mass=coalesce(mass, average)) %>% 
  ## then drop no longer needed average column and rearrange.
  select(site, year, nest, class, order, family, genus, species, binomial, common, 
         category, size, age, mass, source)

# Change mass for juvenile items.
diet.items <- diet.items %>% mutate(mass=case_when(
  age == 'J' ~ 0.5*mass,
  TRUE ~ mass
))

# Also let's collapse age down.
diet.items<- diet.items %>% mutate(age=case_when(
  age == 'J' ~ age,
  TRUE ~ 'A'
))

# Check.
diet.items %>% group_by(source, class, order, family, genus, species, common, age, category, mass) %>% 
  summarize(n=n()) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=source, values_from=n) %>% 
  arrange(class, order, family, genus, species, common) %>% 
  kable() %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options='striped')
```

Here's a list of things to fix in the remains data:

* NOGO mass in prey table may already be juv weight, correct to adults weight
* Fix unidentified ducks
* Fix unidentified catharus

Let's look on a site-by-site basis.

```{r}
new.data %>% group_by(site, year=year(datetime)) %>% 
  summarize(first=date(min(datetime)), last=date(max(datetime)), n.items=n()) %>% 
  mutate(days=difftime(last, first, units=c('days'))) %>% 
  arrange(year, site)
```

Well, that does seem to be about right. I don't think I've misplaced any data. And all the camera data seems legit. I just need to patch up the physical data a bit.
