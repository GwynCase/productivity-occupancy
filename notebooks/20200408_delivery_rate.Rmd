```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

Next step is to calculate biomass delivery rates (ie deliveries/day, biomass/delivery, etc) and examine possible sources of variation (number of chicks, age of chicks). I was worried I might have to somehow standardize or control for different sampling rate by cameras, but I think as long as I keep it within sites it will be fine.

```{r}
# Load up some libraries.
library('tidyverse')
library('lubridate')
library('ggplot2')
library('knitr')
library('kableExtra')

# Import the data.
df <- read.csv('../data/interim/camera_corrected.csv', stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# Do the datetime thing.
df <- df %>% mutate(datetime=parse_date_time(datetime, 
                       orders=c('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', '%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S')))

source('../src/prey_attributes.R')
```

Let's start by calculating the number of deliveries per day.

```{r}
del.per.day <- df %>% filter(interest %in% c('delivery', 'newprey')) %>% 
  mutate(day=date(datetime)) %>% 
  group_by(site) %>% 
  mutate(first=min(day), last=max(day), n.day=last-first) %>% 
  add_count(site, day, name='n.del') %>% 
  add_count(site, name='t.del') %>% 
  mutate(n.day=as.numeric(n.day), per.day=t.del/n.day) %>% 
  dplyr::select(site, day, n.day, n.del, t.del) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  complete(nesting(site), day=seq(min(day), max(day), by='day')) %>% 
  fill(n.day, t.del) %>% 
  mutate(n.del=replace_na(n.del, 0))

del.per.day %>% group_by(site) %>% 
  summarize(mean=mean(n.del))
```

Slightly different numbers than I got in my previous notebook?? I'm not sure why that would be the case. My calculations of total days and total deliveries per site are the same in both cases, but here I calculated number of deliveries individually for each day and then average those per each site, whereas before I just divided deliveries by day. Overall,

```{r}
del.per.day %>% group_by(site) %>% 
  summarize(mean=mean(n.del)) %>% 
  summarize(mean(mean), sd(mean))
```

So that's that. Now how about daily average biomass?

If I just take the biomass per site, and divide by the number of days per site, then that gives me biomass/day.

```{r}
mass.per.site <- items %>% group_by(site) %>%
  mutate(mass=as.numeric(mass)) %>% 
  summarize(t.mass=sum(mass))

mass.per.day <- del.per.day %>% dplyr::select(site, n.day) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  right_join(mass.per.site) %>% 
  mutate(d.mass=t.mass/n.day)

mass.per.day
```

I sure hope that math is sound! Then, to summarize,

```{r}
mass.per.day %>% ungroup() %>% 
  summarize(mean(d.mass), sd(d.mass))
```

That SD seems... really, really high. Maybe I'll try re-calculating this the same way I did the counts, with a daily average rather than a rate. I'll used a modified piece of external code that keeps dates to generate a new "items" list.

```{r}
source('../src/prey_attributes_date.R')

mass.by.day <- items %>% mutate(date=date(datetime), mass=as.numeric(mass)) %>% 
  group_by(site, date) %>% 
  mutate(d.mass=sum(mass)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(site, date, d.mass) %>% 
  arrange(site, date) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% group_by(site) %>% 
  complete(nesting(site), date=seq(min(date), max(date), by='day')) %>% 
  mutate(d.mass=replace_na(d.mass, 0))

mass.by.day %>% group_by(site) %>% 
  summarize(mean=mean(d.mass))
```

That looks slightly different. And when I look at them combined?

```{r}
mass.by.day %>% group_by(site) %>% 
  summarize(mean=mean(d.mass)) %>% 
  summarize(mean(mean), sd(mean))
```

Not a lot better. I guess the deviation really is that wide.
