```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE)
```

I've been running around willy-nilly trying to get a feel for my landscape data and the methods I can use to analyze it, but it's time to actually get a plan.

```{r}
# Import conflict settings.
source('../src/conflicted.R')

# Load libraries.
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
