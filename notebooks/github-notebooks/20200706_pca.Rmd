```

On the one hand, nothing may look promising because I'm using the wrong landscape variables (also, I've only looked at, like, two variables). Alternatively, I'm using the wrong response variable, ie I'm thinking about diet the wrong way. Something to think about is using PCA.

```{r}
# Load up some libraries.
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggbiplot) # This is experimental and must be installed from GitHub.
library(conflicted)
library(sf)
library(raster)
library(landscapemetrics)

# Resolve conflicts.
conflict_prefer('mutate', 'dplyr')
conflict_prefer('select', 'dplyr')
conflict_prefer('arrange', 'dplyr')
conflict_prefer('filter', 'dplyr')
conflict_prefer('summarise', 'dplyr')
conflict_prefer('summarize', 'dplyr')

# Bring in diet data.
df <- read_csv('../data/interim/camera_corrected.csv', guess_max=7000)
source('../src/prey_attributes.R')

head(items)
```

This dataset still has that random *Tamiasciurus* sp. (I should really fix that permanently) so I'll deal with that.

```{r}
items <- items %>% mutate(common=case_when(
  genus == 'Tamiasciurus' & species == 'sp' ~ 'Douglas squirrel',
  TRUE ~ common
))
```

I'm using common because I don't have any duplicate common names and it let's me gracefully include things that are only identified to family or class.

Next I need to rearrange the data so it's summarized by site, which is basically the same as what I did for diversity and similarity analyses.

```{r}
# Twist and reorganize the data.
by.site <- items %>% group_by(site, common) %>% 
  mutate(count=n()) %>% 
  select(site, common, count) %>% 
  distinct() %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=common, values_from=count, values_fill=list(count=0))

# Look at it.
by.site
```

Then actually run the PCA. `prcomp()` wants numerical-only data so I have to make my site names into rownames.

```{r}
# Convert site names to row names.
by.site <- by.site %>% column_to_rownames(var='site')

# Make the PCA.
diet.pca <- prcomp(by.site, center=TRUE, scale=TRUE)

# How'd it come out?
summary(diet.pca)
str(diet.pca)
```

I have this weird feeling I'm doing it wrong and that there should be more than 6 principal components, but aside from the strange number this seems to match all the examples I see online.

Maybe graphing it will help.

```{r}
ggbiplot(diet.pca, labels=rownames(by.site)) +
  xlim(-2, 2) +
  ylim(-2, 2) +
  theme_classic()
```

Well, that's not easy to read, and it doesn't seem to show a ton, anyhow. There seems to be a slight left-right split with UTZ being a bit of an outlier.

You know, it actually doesn't make much sense to include unidentified items, like "average small item." Does it make a difference if I drop those and run it again?

```{r}
# Remove unidentified items.
by.site.2 <- by.site %>% select(-`average small item`, `average medium item`)

# Make a new PCA.
diet.pca.2 <- prcomp(by.site.2, center=TRUE, scale=TRUE)

# Plot the new PCA.
ggbiplot(diet.pca.2, labels=rownames(by.site)) +
  xlim(-2, 2) +
  ylim(-2, 2) +
  theme_classic()
```

Well, that did make a slight difference. But it didn't make a clearer pattern--except perhaps that UTZ remains a bit of an oddball.

One last way of slicing it: using only identified items:

```{r}
# Fix that pesky squirrel.
items <- items %>% mutate(species=case_when(
  genus == 'Tamiasciurus' & species == 'sp' ~ 'douglasii',
  TRUE ~ species
))

# Select only items identified at least to genus.
to.genus <- items %>% filter(genus != 'Unknown') %>% 
  group_by(site, genus, species) %>% 
  mutate(count=n()) %>% 
  select(site, genus, species, count) %>% 
  unite(name, 2:3, sep=' ') %>% 
  distinct() %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=name, values_from=count, values_fill=list(count=0))

# Make site names row names.
to.genus <- to.genus %>% column_to_rownames(var='site')

# Make the PCA.
genus.pca <- prcomp(to.genus, center=TRUE, scale=TRUE)

# Check it out.
ggbiplot(genus.pca, labels=rownames(to.genus)) +
  xlim(-2, 2) +
  ylim(-2, 2) +
  theme_classic()
```

That looks... more like what a PCA should look like. It's roughly the same pattern as before, but more clear: Steller's jays are doing their own weird thing; UTZ is off in it's red-squirrel-and-flying-squirrel corner; RLK, TMC, and MTC are all kind of similar. The main difference is that TMC is more clearly doing it's own thing, just like UTZ, albeit in a different direction. But although it's prettier to look at, I'm not sure it's actually *better*.

```{r}
summary(genus.pca)
```

The first two PCs explain 32% and 25% of the variance, respectively (so a total of 57%), whereas the original PCA (with all items) explains 29% and 26% (55%) and the second PCA (with items identified to class) explains 30% and 25% (also 55%). So, yes, using only items identified to genus does result in a slightly tighter fit, but not by much.

I'd like to get a closer look at which species wind up where.

```{r}
pca.species <- genus.pca$rotation[,1:2] %>% data.frame()

pca.species %>% arrange(PC1)
```

And arranged by the other axis:

```{r}
pca.species %>% arrange(PC2)
```

It's hard to imagine what these axes are capturing.

Since the foraging HSI basically just represents structure (maturity or not), that could be a place to start looking, though it would fail to capture interesting features like natural gaps, water, etc.

* -10 = saltwater
* -2 = freshwater (lakes, ponds), glacier
* -1 = rivers
* 0 = non-habitat land (cities, etc.)
* 1 = low
* 2 = moderate
* 3 = high

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Import habitat HSI shapefile
f.hsi <- st_read('../data/external/foraging_sc.shp')

# Set raster extent based on HSI shapefile.
ext <- extent(f.hsi)

# Make an empty raster to populate with values.
r <- raster(ext, res=c(100, 100))

# Populate BEC polygon data onto empty raster grid.
r.f.hsi <- rasterize(f.hsi, r, 'gridcode')

# Save the raster image.
writeRaster(r.f.hsi, '../data/processed/foraging_sc.tif', format='GTiff')
```

That took foreeeeeeeeeeever!

If picking up later, load up the raster and keep going.

```{r}
# Import the raster.
r.f.hsi <- raster('../data/processed/foraging_sc.tif')

# Define levels for the raster.
f.hsi.levels <- data.frame(ID=c(-10, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3), 
                           class.name=c('ocean', 'freshwater', 'river', 'nil', 'low', 'moderate', 'high'))

# Add the levels to the raster.
levels(r.f.hsi) <- f.hsi.levels
```

Just as a quick thing to try, I'll see if the amount of high-quality habitat means anything, and if the degree of fragmentation means anything. Again, because the HSI is based on VRI data and the TCR site's VRI is all weird, I have to drop it from the analysis.

```{r}
# Import nests and calculate centroids.
sites <- read_csv('../data/processed/the_big_list_of_nests.csv') %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  mutate_at(c('lat', 'lon'), mean) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(starts_with('status')), max) %>% 
  mutate_at(c('telemetry', 'cameras', 'remains'), max) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-nest, -NOTES) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  filter(cameras > 0)

# Drop TCR, ungroup.
sites <- sites %>% filter(site != 'TCR') %>% 
  ungroup()

# Make site table a spatial object and make it UTMs.
sites.sf <- ungroup(sites) %>% st_as_sf(coords=c('lon', 'lat')) %>%
  st_set_crs('+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs') %>%
  st_transform("+proj=utm +zone=10 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs")

# Convert approximate homerange area in ha to radius in m
a.hr.ha <- 3700
r.hr.m <- sqrt(a.hr.ha*10000/pi)

# Calculate area per class per site.
class.area <- sample_lsm(r.f.hsi, y=sites.sf, size=r.hr.m, what='lsm_c_ca', 
           shape='circle') %>% 
  # Amend class number with habitat class name.
  left_join(data.frame(levels(r.f.hsi)), by=c('class'='ID')) %>% 
# Reorganize by site.  
  pivot_wider(id_cols=plot_id, names_from=class.name, values_from=value, 
              values_fill=list(value=0))

# Amend with site names.
class.area <- dplyr::select(sites, site) %>% rownames_to_column() %>% 
  mutate(rowname=as.integer(rowname)) %>% 
  right_join(class.area, by=c('rowname'='plot_id'))

class.area
```


Again, super interesting to see the breakdown here. Ruby Lake takes the cake for ocean and freshwater. Obviously the model isn't good at capturing smaller rivers, because I know several of these sites have rivers flowing through them. TMC has the most decent habitat overall, but Utzilus has the most high habitat... though Ruby Lake might be the best site overall, considering that it has no nil habitat and little low habitat. Basically everything that's not water is good forest.

Now put everything in one table and start modelling.

```{r}
# Join PCA and HSI data together.
class.area <- genus.pca$x[,1:2] %>% data.frame() %>% rownames_to_column(var='site') %>%
  right_join(class.area)

# Plot it.
ggplot(class.area, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, label=site, size=high)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(hjust='inward', nudge_y = 0.5) +
  theme_classic()
```

Again, not promising. Tornberg & Colpaert used PC1 as a fixed factor and territory as a random factor in a mixed-effects model. Since I only have one observation per territory, I don't think there's any need for that.

```{r}
# Make the model.
PC1.x.class <- lm(PC1 ~ high, data=class.area)

# Look at it.
summary(PC1.x.class)
```

Unsurprisingly, it doesn't look like much. Now let's try fragmentation, which is not something I've done with landscapemetrics before. I'm going with `ED` which is edge density. Because all my landscapes are the same size this is really the same as total edge.

```{r}
# Calculate edge.
landscape.edge <- sample_lsm(r.f.hsi, y=sites.sf, size=r.hr.m, what='lsm_l_ed', 
           shape='circle')

# Amend with site names.
landscape.edge <- landscape.edge %>% mutate(site=sites$site)

# Add PCA data.
landscape.edge <- genus.pca$x[,1:2] %>% data.frame() %>% rownames_to_column(var='site') %>%
  right_join(landscape.edge)

# Look at it.
landscape.edge

# Plot it.
ggplot(landscape.edge, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, label=site, size=value)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(hjust='inward', nudge_y = 0.5) +
  theme_classic()
```

That's actually kind of interesting... but I'll come back to that in a sec. First! The model:

```{r}
# Make the model.
PC1.x.edge <- lm(PC1 ~ value, data=landscape.edge)

# Look at it.
summary(PC1.x.edge)
```

Again, nothing interesting. But I thought I might have spotted something between high habitat and edge.

```{r}
# Stuff everything into one (very messy) object.
all.metrics <- right_join(class.area, landscape.edge)

# Have a look.
ggplot(all.metrics, aes(x=value, y=high, label=site)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(hjust='inward', nudge_y = 0.5) +
  theme_classic()
```

Soooooo this seems to indicate that as the density of edges increases, so does the amount of high quality habitat. Which is weird. But it's also only five sites, and I know RLK is going to throw things off because of all that water. But still.
