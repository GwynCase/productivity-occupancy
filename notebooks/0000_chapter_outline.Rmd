***Q: How does landscape and diet affect NOGO occupancy and productivity?***

### 1: Obtain data
1. Use diet data from chapter one.
2. Use landscape data from chapter one.
3. Compile occupancy data...
    1. from South Coast
    2. from Vancouver Island
4. Obtain reproductive success from nest cameras.

### 2: BEC gradient
1. Examine variation in home range size, occupancy, and productivity across precipitation gradient.

### 3: Model reproductive success
1. Model landscape & diet as predictors of RS (occupancy & productivity).
