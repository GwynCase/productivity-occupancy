I did quite a bit of diversity and similarity stuff, but it was a while ago and also not in reference to differences between the two zones. So here's that.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Import conflict settings.
source('../src/conflicted.R')

#Load some libraries.
library(tidyverse)
library(vegan)
library(ggplot2)

# Bring in diet data.
source('../src/prey_attributes_revised.R')

# Add grouping variable.
diet.items <- diet.items %>% mutate(group=case_when(
  class == 'Aves' & family == 'Phasianidae' ~ 'grouse',
  class == 'Aves' & family == 'Corvidae' ~ 'corvid',
  class == 'Aves' & family == 'Turdidae' ~ 'thrush',
  class == 'Aves' ~ 'bird',
  class == 'Mammalia' & genus == 'Tamiasciurus' ~ 'squirrel',
  class == 'Mammalia' & genus == 'Lepus' ~ 'hare',
  class == 'Mammalia' ~ 'mammal',
  TRUE ~ 'unknown'
))

# Bring in zone data.
centroids <- read_csv('../data/interim/zone_centroid_sites.csv')

# Add zone to data and pull out just camera items.
camera.data <- centroids %>% 
  select(site, zone) %>% right_join(diet.items, by=c('site')) %>% 
  filter(method == 'camera')
```

So that's my data wrangled. Now let's twist it wide and calculate an overall diversity score for the whole study area, using items identified to genus or better.

```{r}
# Twist the data.
camera.data.flat <- camera.data %>% filter(binomial != 'Unidentified item') %>% 
  group_by(binomial) %>% 
  mutate(count=n()) %>% 
  select(binomial, count) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=binomial, values_from=count, values_fill=list(count = 0))

# Calculate diversity.
diversity(camera.data.flat[-1], index='simpson')
```

Not very high. Not very low. Hard to say anything interesting about that number, really.

Let's calculate it for each site, next.

```{r}
# Twist the data.
camera.data.site <- camera.data %>% filter(binomial != 'Unidentified item') %>% 
  group_by(site, binomial) %>% 
  mutate(count=n()) %>% 
  select(site, binomial, count) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=binomial, values_from=count, values_fill=list(count = 0))

# Calculate diversity.
plyr::ddply(camera.data.site, ~site, function(x) {
  data.frame(diet.diversity=diversity(x[-1], index='simpson'))
})
```

Okay, that looks familiar. So far so good.

Now to do something new and calculate by zone.

```{r}
# Twist the data.
camera.data.zone <- camera.data %>% filter(binomial != 'Unidentified item') %>% 
  group_by(zone, binomial) %>% 
  mutate(count=n()) %>% 
  select(zone, binomial, count) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=binomial, values_from=count, values_fill=list(count = 0))

# Calculate diversity.
plyr::ddply(camera.data.zone, ~zone, function(x) {
  data.frame(diet.diversity=diversity(x[-1], index='simpson'))
})
```

Aha! So that is interesting, because a higher diversity is exactly what was expected for the transition zone. Specifically, a higher diversity of mammals.

```{r}
# Twist just mammal prey wide.
camera.data.mm <- camera.data %>% filter(binomial != 'Unidentified item') %>% 
  filter(class == 'Mammalia') %>% 
  group_by(zone, binomial) %>% 
  mutate(count=n()) %>% 
  select(zone, binomial, count) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=binomial, values_from=count, values_fill=list(count = 0))

# Look at it.
camera.data.mm
```

Well, just to look at it sure seems like tz birds are eating more kinds of mammals. Let's see what the statistics say.

```{r}
# Calculate diversity.
plyr::ddply(camera.data.mm, ~zone, function(x) {
  data.frame(diet.diversity=diversity(x[-1], index='simpson'))
})
```

Oh, yeah. Is the inverse true? Do cs birds eat a wider variety of birds?

```{r}
# Twist just mammal prey wide.
camera.data.av <- camera.data %>% filter(binomial != 'Unidentified item') %>% 
  filter(class == 'Aves') %>% 
  group_by(zone, binomial) %>% 
  mutate(count=n()) %>% 
  select(zone, binomial, count) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=binomial, values_from=count, values_fill=list(count = 0))

# Calculate diversity.
plyr::ddply(camera.data.av, ~zone, function(x) {
  data.frame(diet.diversity=diversity(x[-1], index='simpson'))
})
```

Nope, tz still higher. And at any rate, these numbers are so close it doesn't seem to matter.

Let's move on to overlap, starting with overlap between individual nests.

```{r}
# Calculate overlap between nests.
camera.data.site %>% column_to_rownames(var='site') %>% 
  vegdist(., method='morisita')
```

Yes, that looks familiar. And now zone.

```{r}
camera.data.zone %>% column_to_rownames(var='zone') %>% 
  vegdist(., method='morisita')
```

Oh, quite low. How interesting. I suppose the thing I really want to know is whether the overlap *within* zones is higher than the overlap *between* zones. Which could be tricky to calculate. I guess really I ought to do more clustering analysis or something, but I'll try this instead...

First coastal:

```{r}
# Overlap within coastal zone.
camera.data %>% filter(binomial != 'Unidentified item') %>% 
  filter(zone == 'cs') %>% 
  group_by(site, binomial) %>% 
  mutate(count=n()) %>% 
  select(site, binomial, count) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=binomial, values_from=count, values_fill=list(count = 0)) %>% 
  column_to_rownames(var='site') %>% 
  vegdist(., method='morisita')
```

Then transition:

```{r}
# Overlap within transition zone.
camera.data %>% filter(binomial != 'Unidentified item') %>% 
  filter(zone == 'tz') %>% 
  group_by(site, binomial) %>% 
  mutate(count=n()) %>% 
  select(site, binomial, count) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=binomial, values_from=count, values_fill=list(count = 0)) %>% 
  column_to_rownames(var='site') %>% 
  vegdist(., method='morisita')
```

But how to collapse this to a single number? Maybe calculate mean overlap??

```{r}
camera.data %>% filter(binomial != 'Unidentified item') %>% 
  filter(zone == 'tz') %>% 
  group_by(site, binomial) %>% 
  mutate(count=n()) %>% 
  select(site, binomial, count) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=binomial, values_from=count, values_fill=list(count = 0)) %>% 
  column_to_rownames(var='site') %>% 
  vegdist(., method='morisita') %>% 
  mean()
```

So overlap within the coastal zone is **0.05** and overlap within the transition zone is **0.21** and overlap between the zones is **0.03.** Which does make nests within the zones slightly (very slightly) more similar to each other than to nests in another zone. This happens to be a very different results than I got earlier from a cluster dendrogram so who knows if this actually means anything.

Finally, lets do some of the summary things I've been doing this whole time for each zone individually.

Start with coastal zone.

```{r}
# How many different species identified from the coastal zone?
camera.data %>% filter(binomial != 'Unidentified item' & zone == 'cs') %>% 
  distinct(binomial, common) %>% summarize(n())

# And which ones?
camera.data %>% filter(binomial != 'Unidentified item' & zone == 'cs') %>% 
  distinct(binomial, common)

# Proportions mammal/avian/unknown?
camera.data %>% filter(zone == 'cs') %>% 
  mutate(total.mass=sum(mass), total.count=n()) %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  mutate(mass.cl=sum(mass), count.cl=n(),
         prop.mass=mass.cl/total.mass, prop.count=count.cl/total.count,
         data='camera') %>% 
  select(class, prop.mass, prop.count) %>% distinct()

# And proportion squirrel.
camera.data %>% filter(zone == 'cs') %>% 
  mutate(total.mass=sum(mass), total.count=n()) %>% 
  filter(genus == 'Tamiasciurus') %>% 
  mutate(mass.sq=sum(mass), count.sq=n(), 
         prop.sq.mass=mass.sq/total.mass, prop.sq.count=count.sq/total.count,
         data='camera') %>% 
  select(prop.sq.mass, prop.sq.count) %>% distinct()
```

And do it all again for transition zone.

```{r}
# How many different species identified from the transition zone?
camera.data %>% filter(binomial != 'Unidentified item' & zone == 'tz') %>% 
  distinct(binomial, common) %>% summarize(n())

# And which ones?
camera.data %>% filter(binomial != 'Unidentified item' & zone == 'tz') %>% 
  distinct(binomial, common)

# Proportions mammal/avian/unknown?
camera.data %>% filter(zone == 'tz') %>% 
  mutate(total.mass=sum(mass), total.count=n()) %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  mutate(mass.cl=sum(mass), count.cl=n(),
         prop.mass=mass.cl/total.mass, prop.count=count.cl/total.count,
         data='camera') %>% 
  select(class, prop.mass, prop.count) %>% distinct()

# And proportion squirrel.
camera.data %>% filter(zone == 'tz') %>% 
  mutate(total.mass=sum(mass), total.count=n()) %>% 
  filter(genus == 'Tamiasciurus') %>% 
  mutate(mass.sq=sum(mass), count.sq=n(), 
         prop.sq.mass=mass.sq/total.mass, prop.sq.count=count.sq/total.count,
         data='camera') %>% 
  select(prop.sq.mass, prop.sq.count) %>% distinct()
```

Again, that same pattern--more mammalian biomass in the transition zone but proportion squirrel is about the same.
