<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Diet Quantification</h2>
<p>We reconstructed prey from pellets and prey remains following a modification of the protocol used by <span class="citation">Lewis et al. (2004)</span>. Within each sample, remains were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic category and the minimum number of individuals counted (i.e. 3 hare femurs = 2 <em>Lepus americanus</em>). Intact pellets and broken but reassembled pellets were analyzed individually within each sample, while fragmented pellets were combined within each sample. Pellets were dissected and feathers, fur, and hard parts (bones, teeth, claws) were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible. We counted the minimum number of individuals represented within the pellet or pellet collection. Prey items from pellets and remains were additionally categorized by size (small = sparrow- or vole-sized, medium = jay- or squirrel-sized, and large = grouse- or hare-sized).</p>
<p>Prey items identified to species were assigned a mass using data from the literature. We assigned mass to mammals from <span class="citation">Nagorsen (2002)</span> and to birds from <span class="citation">Billerman et al. (2020)</span>, using the geographically closest estimates available and averaging the mass of males and females. We treated some homogenous genera for which we could not differentiate species (such as <em>Eutamias</em> and <em>Myotis</em>) as a single taxonomic grouping. For these genera, we assigned mass by averaging the masses of all possible species, based on range maps. Red squirrels (<em>Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</em>) were present at a single site within our study area; when unable to distinguish between the two members of the genus <em>Tamiasciurus</em> we assigned the item to the more common <em>T. douglasii</em>. Unidentified grouse were common among remains; these were assigned the mean mass of the two grouse species present in our study area (<em>Bonasa umbellus</em> and <em>Dendragapus fulignosus</em>). Juveniles prey items (mainly grouse) were assigned 50% of adult mass. Unidentified items were assigned mass by averaging the masses of the identified species in that size category and taxonomic class.</p>
<p>Data from prey remains and egested pellets are known to be biased indices of diet. Some authors have found combining data from both sources to produce relatively unbiased results that can serve as a helpful supplement to nest camera data <span class="citation">(Simmons et al. 1991, Lewis et al. 2004)</span>. After testing for differences between pooled pellets-and-remains data and camera data we found significant differences between these two sources. We therefore report results from pellets, pooled pellets-and-remains, and cameras separately. We do not report results from prey remains alone, as diet composition estimates from prey remains are highly biased and infrequently used in raptor diet studies.<!-- citation needed --></p>
<p>Nest camera photos were reviewed and each new prey item delivered to the nest was recorded and identified to species when possible. When items could not be identified to species, they were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. Prey items identified from photos were assigned a size category and biomass by the same method used for remains and pellets. Partial items were assigned the average mass for that size category and taxonomic class.</p>
<p>We quantified goshawk diet across the entire study area in several ways using data from pellets, pooled pellets-and-remains, and nest cameras. For ease of comparison, we simplified prey items into eight broad categories: tree squirrels (genus <em>Tamiasciurus</em>), hares (genus <em>Lepus</em>), all other mammals, grouse (subfamily Tetraoninae), thrushes (family Turdidae), corvids (family Corvidae), all other birds, and unidentified items. We calculated the relative proportion of avian and mammalian biomass, as well as the relative proportion of biomass composed of tree squirrels (genus <em>Tamiasciurus</em>), which are known to be an important source of prey for goshawks in British Columbia <span class="citation">(Ethier 1999)</span>. For nests with cameras, we additionally quantified diet at the level of the individual nest and further calculated diet diversity with Simpson’s Diversity Index <span class="citation">(Simpson 1949)</span><!-- and overlap between nests with Morisita's Index of Similarity [@krebs_ecological_1999],--> using counts of items identified to genus or better. We report all diet quantification as percent of biomass or mean percent biomass <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> the standard deviation except where counts or percents of items are explicitly specified.</p>
