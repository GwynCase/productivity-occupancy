<p>Effective wildlife conservation often requires understanding diet composition and its consequences for population demographics <span class="citation">(Ferrer and Negro 2004, Stier et al. 2016)</span>. Specialist predators consume a narrow range of prey species, which increases foraging efficiency on preferred prey at the cost of decreased reproductive success for the specialist when that prey is scarce <span class="citation">(Newton 1998)</span>. Generalist predators consume a greater diversity of prey and readily switch between prey species, so are less sensitive to changes in prey abundance <span class="citation">(Steenhof and Kochert 1988, Terraube and Arroyo 2011)</span>. However, for a generalist predator a single key prey species may still be a major driver of reproductive success <span class="citation">(Elmhagen et al. 2000, Resano‐Mayor et al. 2016)</span>. For at-risk predators, increasing the abundance of key prey species may consequentially be a useful conservation tool <span class="citation">(Ferrer and Negro 2004, Forsman et al. 2004, Resano‐Mayor et al. 2016)</span>.</p>
<!-- Newton 1998: "Much depends on how varied the diet is, and whether alternate prey are available when favoured prey are scarce. The more diverse the diet, the less the chance of all prey-species being scarce at the same time. Raptors that have fairly stable food-supplies show some of the most extreme stability in breeding population recorded in birds.... Moreover, the same species may fluctuate numerically in one region, but not another, depending on the stability of the local prey supply." -->
<!-- Elmhagen et al. 2000: "The arctic fox thus manages to combine an opportunistic feeding strategy which ensures survival in a low productivity habitat, with a remarkable ability to exploit lemming peaks for a large reproductive output." -->
<!--Resano-Major et al 2016: "We found that several key demographic parameters of an endangered raptor such as Bonelli’s eagle in western Europe are dependent on the consumption of preferred and alternative prey species and on diet diversity." -->
<!-- Forsman et al. 2004: "Experimental tests of these hypotheses have not been conducted, but it is obvious that Spotted Owls in the Pacific Northwest rely on a few species of nocturnal mammals for the majority of their food, and that forest management practices  that produce healthy populations of these species should benefit Spotted Owls. -->
<p>The northern goshawk (<em>Accipiter gentilis</em>) is a large forest-dwelling raptor with a Holarctic distribution. A generalist predator, the goshawk hunts a variety of small- and medium-sized mammals and birds, including squirrels, rabbits and hares, grouse, jays and crows, and pigeons <span class="citation">(Squires et al. 2020)</span>. Despite this diverse diet, a single prey species or narrow suite of species has a strong effect on the demographics of many goshawk populations. In the Yukon, goshawks depend on snowshoe hare (<em>Lepus americanus</em>) and show strong variation in productivity, mortality, and space use in response to cyclical changes in hare abundance <span class="citation">(Doyle and Smith 1994)</span>. Goshawks in Scandinavia likewise rely on a single prey taxon (subfamily Tetraoninae) and show changes in productivity and occupancy based on the annual abundance of four grouse species <span class="citation">(Tornberg et al. 2005)</span>. In contrast, goshawks in the American Southwest have a wide prey base and regularly consume some fourteen different species <span class="citation">(Boal and Mannan 1994)</span>. Fluctuations in goshawk productivity in this region are small and driven by total prey abundance, though the most influential single species is red squirrel (<em>Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</em>) <span class="citation">(Salafsky et al. 2007)</span>. These examples suggest the identity and influence of key prey species in such an adaptable predator may be specific to each population.</p>
<p>In British Columbia, Canada, the coastal population of northern goshawks is the subject of federal and provincial management which focuses on the protection of breeding habitat to increase nest site availability <span class="citation">(COSEWIC 2013)</span>. Like many raptors, goshawks are generally considered to be limited by both nest site availability and prey abundance <span class="citation">(Reynolds et al. 2006, Rutz et al. 2006)</span>. However, current management plans contain minimal protections for foraging habitat and do not include actions to increase prey populations, in part due to a lack of knowledge regarding goshawk diet and foraging behavior in this region.</p>
<p>Goshawk diet in the coastal Pacific Northwest is variable, with hawks on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, consuming primarily red squirrels <span class="citation">(Ethier 1999)</span>, whereas hawks in nearby southeast Alaska <span class="citation">(Lewis et al. 2006)</span> and western Washington <span class="citation">(Bloxton 2002)</span> consume mostly medium and large birds. The mainland coast of British Columbia is ecologically similar to Vancouver Island and hawks in this region might be predicted to consume a similar diet to hawks on Vancouver Island.
However, a gradient of forest types across the coastal mainland may produce dietary variation at fine scales. Snowshoe hare, a key prey species in many portions of the goshawk’s range, is absent from Vancouver Island, scarce on the coastal mainland, and abundant in the British Columbia interior <span class="citation">(Nagorsen 2002)</span><!-- This citations is a faaaaaaake -->. Goshawk diet on the mainland coast may reflect this variation in available prey between Vancouver Island and the mainland, as well as the variation in prey abundance between the coast and the interior. Where coastal forest types transition to interior forest types, it is unclear how goshawk diet might respond to fine variation in prey availability and abundance. Detailed, local information on goshawk diet is therefore necessary if limiting factors beyond nest site availability are to be included in management plans.</p>
<p>Here we describe the breeding season diet of northern goshawks in coastal British Columbia over a two-year period using nest cameras, egested pellets, and prey remains. We assess whether goshawk diet differs within this region between the wetter <em>coastal</em> zone and the drier <em>transition</em> zone. We further evaluate whether diet composition and diet diversity influence goshawk reproductive success.</p>
