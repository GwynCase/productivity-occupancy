### Study Area

In North America, the northern goshawk ranges from boreal forests of the Yukon south to high-elevation forests of Arizona and New Mexico. Two subspecies are currently recognized: the widespread *atricapillus* and the limited *laingi*. The *laingi* subspecies was first described on the island of Haida Gwaii and is generally smaller in size and darker in plumage than the *atricapillus* subspecies found elsewhere on the continent. It's range, as described by morphological and genetic studies, is limited to the west coast of North America from southeast Alaska through British Columbia and Vancouver Island, and possibly as far south as Washington's Olympic Peninsula. *A. g. laingi* is considered a species at risk in British Columbia by both the federal and provincial governments.

We studied goshawks in the Sunshine Coast and Lower Mainlandregions of the south coast of British Columbia. This population of goshawks is currently classified as *A. g. laingi*, though recent genetic evidence suggests that *laingi* is strictly limited to Haida Gwaii and may lead to future reclassification of the mainland coastal population. The south coast region is primarily temperate rainforest dominated by Douglas-fir (*Pseudotsuga menziesii*), western redcedar (*Thuja plicata*), and western hemlock (*Tsuga heterophylla*). Summers are cool (mean temp) and winters are mild and wet (mean temp, mean precip). Forests are naturally fragmented by mountain ranges and coastal fjords, and artificially fragmented by human development and natural resource extraction. Industrial timber harvest has created a patchwork of differently aged forest stands, ranging from recent clearcuts to old growth over two hundred years old. <!-- check this age --> Within this region, goshawk managers have delineated a *transition zone* comprised of low-elevation valleys connecting the wet coast with the dry interior. Goshawks in this transition zone may have morphological characteristics and habitat requirements intermediate between the coastal *laingi* population and the interior *atricapillus* population. As a result, this zone is of particular interest to goshawk managers.

### Data Collection

We assessed goshawk diet within the BC south coast in 2019 and 2020 through a combination of egested pellets, prey remains, and nest cameras. We identified prey from pellets and remains collected from n nests and from photographs taken at n nests across two ecological regions, the coastal zone and the transition zone. Goshawk nests were located as part of long-term monitoring conducted by the BC Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development (FLNRO). Beginning in 2014, <!-- check this date --> FLNRO inventory crews conducted surveys for breeding goshawks in the south coast following a standard methodology (see citation for detailed survey protocol). Survey areas were delineated in two ways: areas where goshawks were known to have bred previously (known sites), and areas likely to hold breeding goshawks based on GIS data (areas of interest). At sites known to have been occupied previously, surveyors checked known nests for signs of current breeding activity. If no known nest was active, surveyors visually searched for new or previously undiscovered nests and conducted call-playback surveys. Within areas of interest, surveyors conducted call-playback surveys while visually searching the canopy for nests. During call-playback surveys, surveyors walked transect lines spaced approximately 200 meters apart, playing goshawk alarm calls or juvenile begging calls every 200-400 meters and focusing activity on areas of forest likely to contain breeding goshawks.

Prey remains and egested pellets were collected from n occupied sites (2019 n = n, 2020 n = n) with active nests. N sites had collections from both years. Prey remains and pellets were gathered from beneath active nests, from within nests after the juveniles had fledged, and from plucking posts located within the site. All prey remains and all pellets from a single collection location (i.e., a single nest or a single plucking post) were combined for each visit to that location into a single sample. 

At a subset of these sites (2019 n = n, 2020 n = n), cameras were installed at nests to record prey delivered to the chicks. N nests had cameras installed in both years. Nest cameras are an effective and relatively unbiased method of measuring raptor diet. However, cameras may overestimate prey deliveries because goshawks are known to cache prey items for re-delivery to the nest at a later time, creating a risk of double-counting items. Due to the discrete nature of our data, we were unable to differentiate cached and re-delivered items from new items and did not attempt to account for caching in our analysis.

Nest cameras were digital trail cameras (Reconyx, UltraFire and HyperFire models) mounted 2-5 meters distant from and slightly above the nest, usually in an adjacent tree. Cameras in 2019 were programmed to take three photos one second apart when triggered by motion, and an additional one photo every thirty minutes. In 2020, cameras were programmed to take five photos one second apart when triggered by motion, and an additional one photo every twenty minutes. Installation took place during the early nestling phase (between x June and x June) and cameras were left in place until after juveniles dispersed in the fall. Camera site selection was not random but rather constrained by topography, access, and timing of discovery.

Breeding chronology was not available for most sites. At sites with cameras, chicks were aged from photos taken shortly after camera installation using a pictorial guide (Boal 1994). Hatch date and lay date were calculated from this date using known breeding chronology (Boal 1994, McClaren et al. 2015). Productivity was defined as the number of chicks to reach some number of days age (citation). 

### Diet Quantification

We reconstructed prey remains and pellets following a modification of Lewis et al. (2004). Within each sample, prey remains were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic category and the minimum number of individuals counted (i.e. 11 squirrel claws = 2 *Tamiasciurus douglasii*). Intact and broken but reassembled pellets were analyzed individually within each sample, while fragmented pellets were combined within each sample. Pellets were dissected and feathers, fur, and hard parts (bones, teeth, claws) were identified to the lowest taxonomic level. Items were additionally categorized by size (small, medium, or large). We counted the minimum number of individuals represented within the pellet or pellet collection. 

Prey items identified to species were assigned mass using data from the literature. We assigned mass to mammal species from Nagorsen (2002) and birds from Birds of World (2020), using the geographically closest estimates and averaging the mass of males and females. When unable to differentiate between species within a single, relatively homogeneous genus (such as *Eutamias* or *Myotis*), we assigned mass by averaging the masses of all possible species, based on range maps. Red squirrels (*Tamiasciurus hudsonicus*) were present at a single site within out study area; when unable to distinguish between the two members of the genus *Tamiasciurus*, we assigned the item to the more common *T. douglasii*. Unidentified items were assigned mass by averaging the masses of the identified species in that size and class. As very few items could be successfully aged, we did not include prey age in our analysis.

Data from prey remains and egested pellets are known to be heavily biased indices of diet. However, combining data from both sources has been shown to produce relatively unbiased results and can be a helpful supplement to camera data (Lewis et al. 2004). After testing for differences between pooled pellets-and-remains and camera data, we combined pellets and remains for further analysis.

Nest camera photos were reviewed and each new prey item delivered to the nest was recorded and identified to species when possible. When items could not be identified to species, they were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. Prey items identified from photos were assigned a size class and biomass by the same method used for remains and pellets. Partial items were assigned the average mass for that size and class. 

For each source of data (pellets-and-remains and nest cameras) we quantified the diet of each nest in several ways. We calculated the relative proportion of avian and mammalian biomass delivered. We also calculated the proportion of total biomass composed of squirrels (genus *Tamiasciurus*), which are known to be an important source of prey for goshawks in the Pacific Northwest (Ethier 1999; Bloxton 2002; Lewis et al. 2006). We also calculated diet diversity for items identified to genus and species using Simpson's Diversity Index and diet overlap using Morisita's Index of Similarity. 

### Habitat Variables

Sites were classified as either coastal or transition based on whether the site fell within the transition zone defined by the NGRT (citation). We calculated the site centroid as the central point between all known nests within that site and quantified landscape characteristics within four nested scales around around each centroid. Three of these scales were based on a conceptual model of the goshawk territory and locally relevant estimates of each: a 60-ha post-fledging area (PFA), the area used by juveniles immediately after fledging and by females during chick-rearing; a 200-ha breeding area, the core-use area of the territory; and a 3800-ha home range, used by males while foraging. The final scale was a biologically realistic estimate of the maximum distance a male typically travels from the nest while foraging, approximately 32900 ha (unpublished data).

We classified forest type using biogeoclimatic (BEC) subzones and variants, a system of ecological classification widespread in BC. BEC units capture climax vegetation, relative precipitation, and relative temperature in a concise system, but do not describe local vegetation structure. To classify vegetation structure, we used data from the BC Vegetation Resource Inventory (VRI). From the VRI data we extracted eleven land cover classes based on vegetative cover and age (see table?) to a 100-m raster grid. We also extracted four classes of canopy cover: none (<1%), low (1-30%), moderate (31-60%), and high (>60%). <!-- Ok but actually figure out what classes to use --> <!-- Also I think I actually need to say how I picked these variables --> Additionally, we used the suitability index developed for goshawk foraging habitat developed by Mahon et al. (2008) and widely used in goshawk management in BC.

Using the package *landscapemetrics* in R, <!-- don't forget version --> we calculated 3 metrics describing landscape composition: <!-- proportion mature forest, proportion suitable habitat, amount canopy cover --> 3 for configuration, <!-- edge density, edge density of shrub, edge density of suitable habitat -->,  2 for aggregation, <!-- contagion of landcover, contagion of HSI --> and 4 for diversity <!-- Simpson's diversity index (forest type), Simpson's diversity index (landcover), Simpson's evenness index (landcover), patch richness density (landcover) --> for each site (see table). <!-- come back and fix this later -->

### Statistical Analysis

We examined pairwise Pearson's correlation coefficients among x variables at each spatial scale. For strongly correlated variables (give number), both variables were not included in the same multivariate model.

Due to the large number of explanatory landscape variables and small number of nests with sufficient diet data, we developed a set of *a priori* univariate models to examine how landscape influences 2 aspects of diet <!-- diversity and proportion squirrel -->. We selected significant variables (p < 0.05) and tested all univariate and multivariate combinations within each scale. We used Aikake's Information Criterion (AIC) to rank competing models. 

To determine the reproductive consequences of dietary variation, we examined how 2 aspects of diet, diet diversity and proportion of biomass composed of squirrel, influenced productivity. 

<!-- Missing occupancy ~ landscape -->

<!-- A site was considered occupied if a goshawk was detected within the breeding area, regardless of whether breeding activity was confirmed, and unoccupied if no goshawks were observed within the breeding area. Most sites were surveyed once per breeding season, which is 70% effective in detecting active goshawk nests (Woodbridge and Hargis 2006). *Check this citation and reword, almost identical to Miller 2014.* Nests were considered active if an adult was observed brooding on the nest or if chicks were seen or heard within the nest. -->
