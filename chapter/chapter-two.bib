	abstract = {[We studied prey populations and the use and composition of home ranges of 47 Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) over 12 mo in five landscapes in two forest types in southwestern Oregon. We measured 1-yr home ranges of 23 owl pairs, 2-yr home ranges of 13 pairs, and 3-yr home ranges of 3 pairs. The landscapes differed in the degree to which old forest had been fragmented by wildfire and logging. Prey populations were measured at 47 sites in southwestern Oregon. Further data on prey populations were gathered on 14 sites on the Olympic Peninsula in northern Washington, where owls use larger ranges than in Oregon. Owls in Washington used @?1700 ha of old forest annually and primarily one prey species; available prey biomass was 61 g/ha. Owls in Oregon Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests used 813 @+ 133 ha (X @+ SE) of old forest annually and concentrated on two prey species that had a combined biomass of 244 g/ha. Owls in Oregon mixed-conifer forest used 454 @+ 84 ha of old forest annually and three primary prey whose availability averaged 338 g/ha. The amount of old forest used by owls studied for 2 yr was 40\% greater in the 2nd yr than that used in the 1st yr. No increase in use of old forest was seen in the 3rd yr in Douglas-fir forest; 50\% more old forest was used in 3 yr than in the 1st yr in mixed-conifer forest. The most common prey in Washington and Oregon was the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus). In areas where the flying squirrel was the primary prey and where predation was intense (as judged by telemetry), flying squirrel populations were depressed. The addition of medium-sized mammal species, especially woodrats (Neotoma spp.), to the prey base appeared to reduce markedly the amount of old forest used for foraging. Owls traversed 85\% more Douglas-fir forest and 3 times more mixed-conifer forest in the heavily fragmented areas than in the lightly fragmented areas. Overlap among pairs and separation of birds within pairs in space increased with fragmentation. In the most heavily fragmented landscape, social structure appeared to be abnormal, as judged by the proportion of adult-subadult pairs, instances of adult nomadism, and overlap among the home ranges of pairs. The pattern of fragmentation affected the ability of owls to find concentrations of old forest in the landscapes. Even so, almost all the owls consistently selected old forests for foraging and roosting; only one owl selected a younger type as part of its foraging range. Selection of old forest was significant at three levels: landscape, annual home ranges of pairs, and foraging and roosting sites of individuals. The most important prey species, the northern flying squirrel, was twice as abundant in old forest as in young forest in all areas. Landscape indices (dominance, contagion, variance in density of old forest) had less predictive ability than indices based on owl home ranges because owls selected areas of concentrated old forest and because patterning was complex, reflecting four processes, each operating at a different scale: physiography, human land ownership (259-ha scale), history of catastrophic fires, and history of small-scale fires and timber harvesting.]},

reductions in the amount of older forests, and increased areas of dense tree
regeneration – reflect the extent of human influence on these forests. These
changes may also be affecting goshawk populations. Information on
goshawk nesting habitat and foraging behavior, and the food and habitats of
selected goshawk prey, was therefore synthesized to develop a set of
management objectives, desired forest conditions, and management
recommendations. Key objectives of the guidelines are to provide (1)
nesting, post-fledging, and foraging areas for goshawks, and (2) habitat to
support abundant populations of 14 primary goshawk prey. Thinning trees
in the understory, creating small openings in the forest, and prescribed fires
should help produce and maintain the desired forest conditions. Other
habitat elements critical for maintaining both goshawk and prey
populations include abundant snags and large downed logs, woody debris,
interspersion of different tree sizes across the landscape, and the majority of
a goshawk’s home range in older-aged forests. These guidelines should also
benefit forest health, soil productivity, and the habitats of other old-growthdependent
plants and animals.},

	abstract = {[To prevent the further loss of species from landscapes used for productive enterprises such as agriculture, forestry, and grazing, it is necessary to determine the composition, quantity, and configuration of landscape elements required to meet the needs of the species present. I present a multi-species approach for defining the attributes required to meet the needs of the biota in a landscape and the management regimes that should be applied. The approach builds on the concept of umbrella species, whose requirements are believed to encapsulate the needs of other species. It identifies a suite of "focal species," each of which is used to define different spatial and compositional attributes that must be present in a landscape and their appropriate management regimes. All species considered at risk are grouped according to the processes that threaten their persistence. These threats may include habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, weed invasion, and fire. Within each group, the species most sensitive to the threat is used to define the minimum acceptable level at which that threat can occur. For example, the area requirements of the species most limited by the availability of particular habitats will define the minimum suitable area of those habitat types; the requirements of the most dispersal-limited species will define the attributes of connecting vegetation; species reliant on critical resources will define essential compositional attributes; and species whose populations are limited by processes such as fire, predation, or weed invasion will define the levels at which these processes must be managed. For each relevant landscape parameter, the species with the most demanding requirements for that parameter is used to define its minimum acceptable value. Because the most demanding species are selected, a landscape designed and managed to meet their needs will encompass the requirements of all other species.]},

The umbrella species concept is one such proposed short cut. An umbrella species comprises a population of individuals of a particular species whose resource requirements and habitat needs encompass the sufficient home ranges and resource needs of viable populations of co-occurring species. We examined the 17 published criteria available to identify a potential umbrella species and recommend that conservation managers wishing to apply this concept could focus on only seven criteria: well-known biology; large home range size; high probability of population persistence; co-occurrence of species of conservation interest; management needs that are beneficial to co-occurring species; sensitivity to human disturbance; and ease of monitoring. We note however, that rigorous assessment of candidate umbrella species requires such detailed knowledge of candidate and co-occurring species that it seems less of a short cut than planners may wish.},

We compared data from these 3 methods to determine relative merits of different methods for assessing raptor diet as part of a study of the breeding-season diet of northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) in Southeast Alaska. We applied these methods to 5 nests during each of the northern goshawk breeding seasons of 1998 and 1999 and identified 1,540 prey from deliveries, 209 prey from remains, and 209 prey from pellets. The proportions of birds and mammals varied among techniques, as did relative proportions of prey groups and age groups. Prey remains and pellets gave the least-similar diet descriptions. Over 2-day intervals during which data were collected using all 3 methods, prey-delivery data gave more individual prey and prey categories than the 2 other sources of information. We found that prey were not directly tracked in either prey remains or pellets compared with prey delivery videography. Analysis of prey-delivery videography provided the most complete description of diet, and we recommend that studies attempting to describe diet use this technique, at least as part of their methodology.},

	abstract = {During the 1990s, we conducted research on the distribution, productivity, and habitat relationships of Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) in eastern Oregon and Washington. Our research was initiated primarily in response to concerns raised about the status of Northern Goshawks in the western US, and coincided with early attempts to list the species as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act and the publication of management guidelines for goshawks in the southwestern US. To develop baseline information on the status, distribution, and habitat relationships of goshawks in eastside forests (i.e., east of the Cascade Mountain Range) in the Pacific Northwest, we established study areas on three national forests in eastern Oregon in 1992, adding a fourth study area in central Washington in 1994. We focused on the breeding season and nesting habitat because of its primary importance to goshawk ecology and the logistical feasibility of finding nests. Density of breeding pairs ranged from 0.03-0.09/100 ha, and annual productivity ranged from 0.3-2.2 young fledged/nest. Goshawks selected forest stands with trees of larger diameter and greater canopy closure for nesting than available in the landscape. Occasionally nests could be found in large trees in open-canopied stands. As distance increased from the nest site, forest type and structure became more heterogeneous and the prevalence of older-seral-stage forest declined. Dry or wet openings were present in most territories, often within close proximity to nest stands. Goshawks ate a variety of mammalian and avian prey. Mammal species made up a larger portion of prey biomass on two of the national forests, but avian species appeared to be more prevalent in the diet of goshawks in the most northern study area. We recommend that the existing management guidelines for goshawks in the Southwest form a basis for management in the inland Pacific Northwest, particularly with regard to nested spatial concepts, emphasis on management of prey, and the use of silviculture to promote the development and replacement of old growth or late-seral-stage forest. Our research and management recommendations can be used in concert with the Southwestern management guidelines to establish a mix of vegetation structural stages to support goshawk populations, their prey, and other forest wildlife species specifically for the inland Pacific Northwest.},

	abstract = {Northern Goshawks occupying the Alexander Archipelago, Alaska, and coastal British Columbia nest primarily in old-growth and mature forest, which results in spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of individuals across the landscape. We used microsatellite and mitochondrial data to infer genetic structure, gene flow, and fluctuations in population demography through evolutionary time. Patterns in the genetic signatures were used to assess predictions associated with the three population models: panmixia, metapopulation, and isolated populations. Population genetic structure was observed along with asymmetry in gene flow estimates that changed directionality at different temporal scales, consistent with metapopulation model predictions. Therefore, Northern Goshawk assemblages located in the Alexander Archipelago and coastal British Columbia interact through a metapopulation framework, though they may not fit the classic model of a metapopulation. Long-term population sources (coastal mainland British Columbia) and sinks (Revillagigedo and Vancouver islands) were identified. However, there was no trend through evolutionary time in the directionality of dispersal among the remaining assemblages, suggestive of a rescue–effect dynamic. Admiralty, Douglas, and Chichagof island complex appears to be an evolutionarily recent source population in the Alexander Archipelago. In addition, Kupreanof island complex and Kispiox Forest District populations have high dispersal rates to populations in close geographic proximity and potentially serve as local source populations. Metapopulation dynamics occurring in the Alexander Archipelago and coastal British Columbia by Northern Goshawks highlight the importance of both occupied and unoccupied habitats to long-term population persistence of goshawks in this region.},

	abstract = {Diet studies present numerous methodological challenges. We evaluated the usefulness of
commercially available trail-cameras for analyzing the diet of Northern Goshawks (Accipiter
gentilis) as a model for nesting raptors during the period 2007–2011. We compared diet estimates
obtained by direct camera monitoring of 80 nests with four indirect analyses of prey
remains collected from the nests and surroundings (pellets, bones, feather-and-hair remains,
and feather-hair-and-bone remains combined). In addition, we evaluated the performance
of the trail-cameras and whether camera monitoring affected Goshawk behavior.
The sensitivity of each diet-analysis method depended on prey size and taxonomic group,
with no method providing unbiased estimates for all prey sizes and types. The cameras registered
the greatest number of prey items and were probably the least biased method for estimating
diet composition. Nevertheless this direct method yielded the largest proportion of
prey unidentified to species level, and it underestimated small prey. Our trail-camera system
was able to operate without maintenance for longer periods than what has been reported in
previous studies with other types of cameras. Initially Goshawks showed distrust toward the
cameras but they usually became habituated to its presence within 1–2 days. The habituation
period was shorter for breeding pairs that had previous experience with cameras. Using
trail-cameras to monitor prey provisioning to nests is an effective tool for studying the diet of
nesting raptors. However, the technique is limited by technical failures and difficulties in
identifying certain prey types. Our study also shows that cameras can alter adult Goshawk
behavior, an aspect that must be controlled to minimize potential negative impacts.},

We also evaluated the potential energetic value of several prey species. We found that Northern Spotted Owls (n = 11 pairs and 1 single male) in northwestern California differentially selected the dusky-footed woodrat (Neotoma fuscipes), a moderately large sigmodontine rodent (x̄ mass = 232 g). When foraging, owls selected late seral forest edge sites where dusky-footed woodrats were more abundant. Although the relationship between site selection, prey abundance, and the owl's breeding success was not statistically significant, the average abundance of dusky-footed woodrats at sites foraged by breeding owls (x̄ = 11.4 woodrats 100-trap-nights-1) was greater than at sites foraged by nonbreeding owls (x̄ = 4.7 woodrats 100-trap-nights-1). We estimated that a male Spotted Owl would require 150,015 to 336,232 kJ over a 153-day period while helping to produce one young, and concluded that the selection of woodrats provided a potential energetic benefit over the use of other prey.

Results revealed a genetically distinct population of northern goshawks on the archipelago of Haida Gwaii and subtle structuring among other North American sampling regions. We then developed genotyping assays for ten loci that are highly differentiated between the two main genetic clusters, allowing inclusion of hundreds of low-quality samples and confirming that the distinct genetic cluster is restricted to Haida Gwaii. As the laingi form was originally described as being based on Haida Gwaii (where the type specimen is from), further morphological analysis may result in this name being restricted to the Haida Gwaii genetic cluster. Regardless of taxonomic treatment, the distinct Haida Gwaii genetic cluster along with the small and declining population size of the Haida Gwaii population suggests a high risk of extinction of an ecologically and genetically distinct form of northern goshawk. Outside of Haida Gwaii, sampling regions along the coast of BC and southeast Alaska (often considered regions inhabited by laingi) show some subtle differentiation from other North American regions. These results will increase the effectiveness of conservation management of northern goshawks in northwestern North America. More broadly, other conservation-related studies of genetic variation may benefit from the two-step approach we employed that first surveys genomic variation using high-quality samples and then genotypes low-quality samples at particularly informative loci.},

	abstract = {[1. Because of their popular appeal, top vertebrate predators have frequently been used as flagship or umbrella species to acquire financial support, raise environmental awareness and plan systems of protected areas. However, some have claimed that the utilization of charismatic predators may divert a disproportionate amount of funding to a few glamorous species without delivering broader biodiversity benefits, an accusation aggravated by the fact that the conservation of top predators is often complex, difficult and expensive. Therefore, tests are needed of whether apex predators may be employed to achieve ecosystem-level targets. 2. To test such a hypothesis, we compared the biodiversity values recorded at the breeding sites of six raptor species, differing widely in diet and habitat associations, with those observed at three types of control locations, (i) sites randomly chosen in comparable habitat, (ii) breeding sites of a randomly selected bird species of lower trophic level and (iii) breeding sites of a lower trophic level species with specialized ecological requirements. Biodiversity was measured as the richness and evenness of bird, butterfly and tree species. 3. Biodiversity levels were consistently higher at sites occupied by top predators than at any of the three types of control sites. Furthermore, sites occupied by top predators also held greater densities of individual birds and butterflies (all species combined) than control sites. 4. In a reserve-selection simulation exercise, networks of protected sites constructed on the basis of top predators were more efficient than networks based on lower trophic level species, enabling higher biodiversity coverage to be achieved with a smaller number of reserves. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide evidence of a link between the strategic utilization of top predatory species and ecosystem-level conservation. We suggest that, at least in some biological systems, conservation plans based on apex predators could be implemented to deliver broader biodiversity benefits.]},

As a consequence, breeding performance may become most strongly dependent on factors that affect individual foraging where resources are poor. We investigated potential links between foraging behaviour, reproductive performance and morphology in a goshawk Accipiter gentilis population, which experienced markedly different resource levels in two different parts of the study area (rabbit-rich vs. rabbit-poor areas). Our analyses revealed (1) that rabbit abundance positively affected male reproductive output; (2) that age, size and rabbit abundance (during winter) positively affected different components of female reproductive output; (3) that foraging movements were inversely affected by rabbit abundance for both sexes (for females, this may mainly have reflected poor provisioning by males in the rabbit-poor area); (4) that younger breeders (both in males and females) tended to move over larger distances than older individuals (which may have reflected both a lack of hunting experience and mate searching); and (5) that male body size (wing length) showed some covariation with resource conditions (suggesting possible adaptations to hunting agile avian prey in the rabbit-poor area). Although we are unable to establish firm causal relationships with our observational data set, our results provide an example of how territory quality (here, food abundance) and individual features (here, age and morphology) may combine to shape a predator's foraging behaviour and, ultimately, its breeding performance.},

	abstract = {Abstract: We responded to the claim by Greenwald et al. (2005) that the management recommendations for the northern goshawk in the Southwestern United States (MRNG; Reynolds et al. 1992), a food web-based conservation plan that incorporated both northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and multiple prey habitats, may be inadequate to protect goshawks. Greenwald et al. (2005) based this claim on their review of 12 telemetry studies of goshawk habitat selection and 5 nontelemetry studies of the effects of vegetation structure at the home range scale on goshawk nest occupancy and reproduction that appeared after the 1992 publication of the MRNG. Greenwald et al. (2005) summarized their review as showing that 1) goshawks were habitat specialists limited to forests with mature and old-growth structures including large trees, high canopy cover, multiple canopy layering, and abundant woody debris; 2) habitats were not selected on the basis of prey abundance and, therefore, managing for prey habitats diluted goshawk habitats; and 3) selection for openings, edges, and habitat diversity was inconclusive. Our review found that when the studies' respective authors pooled their radiotagged goshawks there were weak to strong selections for old forest structures. However, the studies also documented extensive variation in use of vegetation types and structures by individual goshawks; some avoided openings, edges, young forests, and old forests, whereas others selected for these characteristics. Additionally, by virtue of their wide geographic distribution, the studies showed that the focal populations themselves occurred in a variety of forest types, some with large structural differences. We found no evidence in Greenwald's et al. (2005) review that the MRNG are inadequate to protect goshawks. Rather, the studies reviewed by Greenwald et al. (2005), as well as many studies they missed, supported the MRNG. The suggestion of inadequacy by Greenwald et al. (2005) appeared rooted in misunderstandings of goshawk habitats described in the MRNG, a discounting of the extent of variation in vegetation structural and seral stages used by goshawks, a limited understanding of the extent to which prey limits goshawks, a failure to recognize the dynamic nature of forests, and an incomplete review of the literature. We believe the MRNG are adequate because they maximize the sustainable amount of mature and old forests in goshawk home ranges and specify the kinds and intermixtures of prey habitats within home ranges. Implementation of MRNG should reduce the likelihood that the availability of vegetation structures suited to goshawk nesting and foraging, as well as abundance and availability of prey, will limit goshawk nest occupancy and reproduction.},

	abstract = {[In long-lived raptors, research suggests that some nest areas consistently fledge more young than others, with the majority of young in the population being produced by a few females. If this claim were true for Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) populations, it would benefit land managers to identify high-quality goshawk breeding habitat. We examined whether the number of young fledged varied spatially among Northern Goshawk nest areas within three study areas where long-term reproductive data from goshawks were available: (1) Vancouver Island, British Columbia; (2) Jemez Mountains, New Mexico; and (3) Uinta Mountains, Utah. A mixed-model ANOVA indicated there was minimal spatial variation in nest productivity among nest areas within the three study locations. Rather, nest areas exhibited high temporal variability in nest productivity within each study area. These results suggest that temporal patterns such as local weather and fluctuating prey populations influenced Northern Goshawk reproduction more than spatial patterns such as habitat characteristics. Nest productivity may inadequately reflect spatial patterns in goshawk reproduction and so it would be premature to assume that habitat quality for Northern Goshawks was equal among nest areas within these study areas. Future research should examine spatial variability among nest areas in adult and juvenile survival rates to gain a complete picture of population responses to habitat change. /// Investigaciones en aves rapaces longevas sugieren que consistentemente más polluelos empluman en algunos sitios de anidación que en otros y que la mayoría de los juveniles en la población son producidos por unas pocas hembras. Si esto fuera cierto para poblaciones de Accipiter gentilis, ayudaría a las autoridades ambientales a identificar hábitat reproductivo de alta calidad para la especie. Evaluamos si el número de polluelos emplumados varió espacialmente entre sitios de anidación de A. gentilis dentro de tres áreas de estudio para las cuales había datos reproductivos de largo plazo disponibles: (1) Vancouver Island, British Columbia; (2) Jemez Mountains, New Mexico; y (3) Uinta Mountains, Utah. Un modelo mixto de análisis de varianza indicó que la variación espacial en la productividad de los nidos entre sitios de anidación dentro de las tres áreas de estudio fue mínima. En cambio, los sitios de anidación presentaron una alta variabilidad temporal en la productividad de los nidos dentro de cada área de estudio. Estos resultados sugieren que los patrones temporales como el clima y las fluctuaciones de las poblaciones de presas influencian la reproducción de A. gentilis más que los patrones espaciales como las características del hábitat. La productividad de los nidos puede reflejar inadecuadamente los patrones espaciales de la reproducción de A. gentilis, de modo que sería prematuro suponer que la calidad de hábitat fue igual entre los sitios de anidación dentro de las áreas de estudio.

Prairie falcons had the most specialized diets, and red-tailed hawks the most diverse. None of the three raptor diets reflected the relative abundance of prey types in the environment. (3) Diet diversity of each of the three raptor species expanded as the abundance of their main prey declined. Ground squirrels and birds were alternate prey for eagles; gopher snakes, kangaroo rats, and rabbits were alternate prey for red-tailed hawks. Prairie falcons had no single important alternate prey species. (4) Yearly frequencies of main prey in each of the three raptor diets were correlated with the annual abundance of that prey in the environment. Frequencies of alternate prey were correlated not with their own abundance but inversely with the abundance of the principal prey. (5) Eagle preference for jack rabbits was strong and unaffected by changes in prey densities. Red-tailed hawk selectivity for jack rabbits was inversely related to ground squirrel abundance, suggesting `switching' behaviour. Prairie falcon selectivity for ground squirrels did not vary with ground squirrel densities. (6) Prey choice was generally consistent with predictions of the original optimal diet model, but red-tailed hawk prey selection appeared to depend on relative prey densities. Degree of diet specialization and plasticity are probably related to a raptor's life-history characteristics, and may influence a raptor's effects on its prey populations.]},

The breeding-season diet of Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) includes both mammalian and avian species, varies geographically, and is often dependent upon tree squirrels of the genera Sciurus and Tamiasciurus. We studied alternative prey sources of Northern Goshawks in the South Hills of south-central Idaho, an area where tree squirrels are naturally absent and other prey frequently important in the diet of goshawks, such as smaller corvids, are uncommon. We quantified the diet of goshawks using nest cameras and surveyed abundance of prey using line transects. We found that goshawks consumed roughly 18.5\% birds and 78.7\% mammals by biomass, with diet dominated by the Belding's ground squirrel (Urocitellus beldingi, also known as Spermophilus beldingi; 74.8\% of total biomass consumed); however, the percentages of mammals and birds in the diet varied between years. The diet was low in diversity, with high overlap among nests, indicating a strong local dependence on the dominant food item. Lastly, the proportion of mammalian prey in the diet was greater in larger broods than in smaller broods. This study provides new insight into the adaptability of the goshawk, particularly in areas with unique prey assemblages.},

	abstract = {(1) Four released goshawks were radio-tracked for up to 29 days at a time in Oxfordshire. Their hunting flights were mostly at 3--4 min intervals, for an average of 200 m in open country. They remained in woodland for 50\% of the time although only 12\% of their ranges was wooded. This preference resulted not from hawks flying less frequently in woodland, but because they flew half the distance between perches and doubled back twice as often in woodland as in open country. (2) Most attacks were initiated from perches, and only 3\% were at prey already in flight. Six percent of observed attacks were successful, but hawks were most successful when hunting out of sight. They killed, on average, once in every 262 minutes of hunting. Seventy percent of prey was taken in or from woodland, a higher proportion than expected from the time spent there. (3) There were no sex or age differences in the preference for woodland of twenty-two wild goshawks radio-tracked in Sweden. Woodland within 200 m of open country was the most preferred habitat, and the majority of kills were made there. Range size was related to the proportion of a range that was woodland edge, and to prey availability. It is suggested that hawks covered the amount of woodland edge which gave adequate kills at the prevailing prey density, range size then being the area which happened to include that amount of woodland edge.},

However, empirical data are needed to indicate whether goshawks select foraging habitat based on prey abundance, on the presence of forest structures that favor their hunting
strategy, or both. During the 1993 and 1994 breeding seasons, we indexed prey abundance and measured forest structure at sites used by radio-tagged goshawks and at nearby paired
sites that lacked evidence of goshawk use (contrast plots). Goshawks apparently did not select foraging sites based on prey abundance; indeed, abundances of some prey were lower
on used than on contrast plots. Goshawks selected foraging sites that had higher canopy closure (P 5 0.006), greater tree density (P 5 0.001), and greater density of trees .40.6
cm dbh (P , 0.0005) than on contrast plots. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that goshawk morphology and behavior are adapted for hunting in moderately dense, mature forests, and that prey availability (as determined by the occurrence of favorable vegetation
structure where prey are present above a low threshold) is more important than prey density in habitat selection. Nonetheless, current management recommendations for increasing prey
abundance also can create a forest structure more favorable for hunting by goshawks, particularly if stands are managed for canopy closure values above the prescribed minimum
level of 40\% canopy.},

	abstract = {[In the 1990s the federal forests in the Pacific Northwest underwent the largest shift in management focus since their creation, from providing a sustained yield of timber to conserving biodiversity, with an emphasis on endangered species. Triggered by a legal challenge to the federal protection strategy for the Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), this shift was facilitated by a sequence of science assessments that culminated in the development of the Northwest Forest Plan. The plan, adopted in 1994, called for an extensive system of late-successional and riparian reserves along with some timber harvest on the intervening lands under a set of controls and safeguards. It has proven more successful in stopping actions harmful to conservation of old-growth forests and aquatic systems than in achieving restoration goals and economic and social goals. We make three suggestions that will allow the plan to achieve its goals: (1) recognize that the Northwest Forest Plan has evolved into an integrative conservation strategy, (2) conserve old-growth trees and forests wherever they occur, and (3) manage federal forests as dynamic ecosystems.]},

	abstract = {The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) was petitioned in 1997 to consider listing Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis atricapillus) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, west of the 100th meridian of the contiguous United States. In their 12-mo finding issued in June 1998, the FWS determined that listing this population as threatened or endangered was not warranted and based that decision on review existing population and habitat information. Because the status of goshawks in the western U.S. continues to be contentious and the FWS finding has been challenged, the Raptor Research Foundation, Inc. and The Wildlife Society jointly formed a committee to review information regarding the status of the goshawk population in the contiguous U.S. west of the 100th meridian. The committee was requested to: (1) determine if there is evidence of a population trend in goshawks in the western U.S., excluding Alaska; (2) determine if there is evidence that goshawks nesting in the eastern and western U.S. represent distinctive, genetically unique populations; and (3) evaluate evidence for goshawk-habitat relations, including any association with large, mostly-unbroken tracts of old growth and mature forests. Based on existing information, the committee concluded: (1) existing data are not adequate to assess population trend in goshawks west of the 100th meridian; (2) existing analyses of phylogeography have not provided evidence of genetic differences among recognized (atricapillus, laingi) or putative (apache) subspecies, and the genetic distinctness of atricapillus goshawks in western and eastern North America is not known; and (3) at present, assessing the status of goshawks solely using distribution of late-successional forests is not appropriate, based on the current understanding of goshawk-habitat relations, although goshawks clearly use and often select late-successional forests for nesting and foraging. We provide recommendations on information needs to assess status and population trend of goshawks in the western U.S. ?? 2005 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

	abstract = {[In the face of limited funding, knowledge, and time for action, conservation efforts often rely on shortcuts for the maintenance of biodiversity. The umbrella species concept-proposed as a way to use species requirements as a basis for conservation planning-has recently received growing attention. We reviewed the literature to evaluate the concept's general usefulness. An umbrella species is defined as a species whose conservation is expected to confer protection to a large number of naturally co-occurring species. This concept has been proposed as a tool for determining the minimum size for conservation areas, selecting sites to be included in reserve networks, and setting minimum standards for the composition, structure, and processes of ecosystems. Among the species suggested as potential umbrellas, most are large mammals and birds, but invertebrates are increasingly being considered. Eighteen research papers, most of which were based on hypothetical reserves or conservation networks, have provided evaluations of umbrella species schemes. These show that single-species umbrellas cannot ensure the conservation of all co-occurring species because some species are inevitably limited by ecological factors that are not relevant to the umbrella species. Moreover, they provide evidence that umbrella species from a given higher taxon may not necessarily confer protection to assemblages from other taxa. On the other hand, multi-species strategies based on systematic selection procedures (e.g., the focal species approach) offer more compelling evidence of the usefulness of the concept. Evaluations of umbrella species schemes could be improved by including measures of population viability and data from many years, as well as by comparing the efficiency of the proposed scheme with alternative management strategies.]},

	abstract = {Factors linked with intraspecific variation in trophic diversity are still poorly understood in generalist species like the Montagu’s harrier (Circus pygargus) but may have important implications for conservation management at a wide scale. We described geographic patterns of Montagu’s harrier diet across Eurasia, gathering diet data from 30 studies in 41 areas from 11 countries. We grouped prey as invertebrates, reptiles, small mammals, large mammals, eggs, small birds and large birds, and calculated the contribution of each prey type to the diet (as \% biomass) and Shannon’s Diversity Index for each study site. We analysed qualitative estimates of prey abundance in relation to latitude and longitude, then diet composition in relation to habitat of the study area and prey abundance estimates. Diet diversity of Montagu’s harriers increased from north to south, while abundance of all prey groups other than small mammals showed the opposite trends. Agricultural areas in northern latitudes seemed to hold high densities of small mammals, but low densities of alternative prey. Overall, birds were the main prey in most of Montagu’s harrier’s distribution range, although the relative importance of each prey type in the diet was significantly explained by its local abundance and habitat, confirming the opportunistic foraging strategy of this raptor species. Consumption of mammals was an exception to this trend, being negatively associated with the abundance of alternative prey, suggesting that this prey is not preferred. Trophic diversity in this species could be influenced by land-use changes through variations in the abundance and availability of prey, which could impact its population dynamics. This may be particularly important for northern populations of Montagu’s harriers breeding in agricultural habitats, where trophic diversity is already low.},

	abstract = {Developing comprehensive conservation strategies requires knowledge of factors influencing population growth and persistence. Although variable prey resources are often associated with fluctuations in raptor demographic parameters, the mechanisms of food limitation are poorly understood, especially for a generalist predator like the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis). To determine the reproductive responses of goshawks to variable prey populations, we evaluated 823 goshawk breeding opportunities on the Kaibab Plateau, Arizona, USA, during 1994–2002. Concurrently, density was estimated for 4 prey species (2 avian, 2 mammalian). We explored the relationship between goshawk reproduction and prey density at one temporal scale (year) and 2 spatial scales (study area, forest type). Prey density for all 4 species combined accounted for 89\% of the variation in goshawk reproduction within the entire study area (P {\textless} 0.001), 74\% in mixed conifer forest (P = 0.003) and 85\% in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest (P {\textless} 0.001). We found that an incremental increase in prey density resulted in a greater increase in goshawk reproduction in ponderosa pine forest than in mixed conifer forest, suggesting that the denser structural conditions of mixed conifer forest may have reduced prey availability. Red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) density explained more annual variation in goshawk reproduction within the study area (r2 = 0.87, P {\textless} 0.001), mixed conifer forest (r2 = 0.80, P = 0.001), and ponderosa pine forest (r2 = 0.85, P {\textless} 0.001) than did any other individual species. Although certain prey species were more strongly correlated with fluctuations in goshawk reproduction than were others, the high model selection uncertainty and the strong relationship between total prey density and number of goshawk fledglings produced indicated that alternate prey species were readily substituted for one another. Therefore, conservation strategies concerned with the status of goshawk populations should incorporate forest management practices that increase the abundance, diversity, and availability of prey resources.},

Our goals were to develop a protocol for installing motion-activated trail cameras at Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetas) nests to record diet information and productivity, and to estimate prey detection probability using different diet study methods. In 2014 and 2015, we installed cameras at 12 Golden Eagle nests with 18-42-d-old nestlings. Following installation, we monitored adult behavior using direct observation and post-installation image review. At two nests, adult eagles did not return to nests or exhibited behaviors suggesting avoidance of the cameras, but returned to the nests after cameras were removed. We visited the 10 remaining nests every 4 d to collect prey remains and pellets to generate prey-specific detection estimates for both images, and prey remains and pellets. Compared to inspection of prey remains and pellets, cameras recorded twice the number of prey (622 vs. 316), were more likely to detect the smallest and largest prey, and cost half as much. Cameras recorded productivity, fledging dates, and in one case, a nestling death. Trail cameras may be a reliable and cost-effective option to address clearly defined research goals and obtain required information about eagle behavior and nest contents. However, cameras should be used judiciously because installation creates a persistent manipulation at the nest. Camera appearance should be minimized, and post-installation monitoring that allows for timely responses to nest-avoidance behavior by adult eagles is important to prevent adverse effects on nesting success.},

	abstract = {Specialist species, using a narrow range of resources, are predicted to be more efficient when foraging on their preferred food than generalist species consuming a wider range of foods. We tested whether the foraging efficiency of the pallid harrier Circus macrourus, a vole specialist, and of sympatric Montagu's harriers C. pygargus, a closely related generalist, differed in relation to inter-annual variations in vole abundance over five years (including two peak, one intermediate and two low vole abundance years). We show that the hunting parameters of pallid harriers strongly varied with vole abundance (higher encounter rates, capture rates and proportion of successful strikes in high than intermediate and low vole abundance years, respectively), whereas Montagu's harriers showed stable capture rates and hunting success (proportion of strikes that were successful), irrespective of vole abundance. Encounter rates and capture rates were higher for pallid than for Montagu's harriers when voles were abundant, but lower when voles were scarce. The hunting success of pallid harriers was also lower than that of Montagu's harriers when voles were scarce, and when they had to target alternative preys, in particular birds. Overall, estimated biomass intake rate was 40\% higher for pallid harriers than for Montagu's harriers when voles were abundant, but 50\% lower when voles were scarce. Our results indicate that specialists predators, like pallid harriers, which evolve specific adaptations or breeding strategies, do better when their preferred prey is abundant, but may face a cost of specialisation, being not efficient enough when their preferred prey is scarce. These results have broader implications for understanding why specialist predators are, in general, more vulnerable than generalists, and for predicting how specialists can cope with rapid environmental changes affecting the abundance or predictability of their preferred resources.},

	abstract = {Reliable and abundant resources are likely to favour specialization, while unpredictable environmental variation should favour a generalist strategy. The rodent population cycles of northern latitudes can be seen as both predictable and unpredictable, depending on the scale in time and space. The arctic fox Alopex lagopus is an opportunistic carnivore, but paradoxically, it seems to function as a specialist on fluctuating rodent Arvicolinae populations in most inland areas. We have studied the dietary response of arctic foxes in Sweden during 5 years of varying abundance of Norwegian lemming Lemmus lemmus, and how these changes influenced the reproductive success of the foxes. The arctic fox population on mainland Fennoscandia is threatened by extinction and the situation has deteriorated during the 1980s and 1990s because of an absence of lemming peaks. Our results showed that in all years, lemming was the main prey for arctic foxes, with 85\% frequency of occurrence in summer faeces (scats). Bird remains (mainly Passeriformes) were present in 34\% of the scats, reindeer Rangifer tarandus in 21\%, voles and shrews in 4\% and hares Lepus timidus in 2\% of the scats. The occurrences of lemming, bird and larger mammal (reindeer and hare) remains in the scats varied significantly between years. Temporal variations within summer seasons and dietary differences between sub-areas, indicated that arctic foxes fed opportunistically on the alternative prey types. Den occupancy rates were positively correlated with lemming population densities during the previous winter, indicating a strong numerical response. We conclude that from a functional aspect, the arctic fox in Sweden is a lemming specialist, since lemming is the main prey and their abundance is the best predictor of arctic fox reproductive success. Other prey are used opportunistically in relation to their availability.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Despite recovery plans, the Spanish Imperial Eagle (Aquila adalberti) and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) are in danger of extinction. These two flagship species tend to occur in pristine Mediterranean forests, and both prey preferentially on the rabbit (Oryctologus cuniculus). Spanish lynxes and eagles have sister species in continental Europe, the Eurasian lynx ( Lynx europaeus) and the Eastern Imperial Eagle (A. heliaca), respectively. Recent genetic evidence indicates that these two pairs of species started to diverge from their ancestor species slightly less than 1 million years ago, when the longest-lasting Pleistocene glaciations covered Europe. We hypothesize that the Iberian lynx and the Spanish Imperial Eagle emerged as separate species in the Pleistocene refugia of southern Spain, where they hunted yet another locally evolved species, the rabbit, on which they have become dependent for survival. Two large predators that emerged at the same time may go extinct simultaneously because of their inability to shift to alternative prey. Many other relict species, including numerous species from oceanic islands, have naturally small populations because of evolutionary constraints and are permanently threatened with extinction. Recovery plans aimed at putting these species out of danger are unrealistic, as their populations are and have been chronically scarce. We suggest that what these species need are maintenance plans designed to buffer population declines due to either stochastic or human-induced events. A metaphor for this would be “emergency care units” for conservation.},

The pooled mean yearly breeding density varied from 0.1 to 2.4 pairs/km{\textasciicircum}2. The number of nesting EKs (range 2-46 pairs), SOs (0-49), and LOs (0-19) fluctuated in close accordance with the spring density of Microtus (M. agrestis and M. epiroticus) voles. The mean yearly number of fledglings produced per pair ranged from 0.4 to 3.8 and, for each species, was positively correlated with spring density of Microtus voles. Due to their high degree of mobility, EKs, SOs, and LOs were able to track the population fluctuations of their microtine prey without time lags. An increase in microtine densities caused a rapid immigration into the study area and a decrease caused a rapid emigration from the area. Microtus voles were the most important prey group by mass in the diet of each species. Water voles, bank voles, shrews, and small birds were the most frequent alternate prey. The spring density of Microtus spp. was positively correlated with the percentage of these voles in the diet of EK, SO, and LO. The pooled functional response curve of these three raptor species to the fluctuating densities of Microtus spp. was close to linear, indicating that consumption rates are independent of vole densities. Breeding EKs, SOs, and LOs seemed to take a larger proportion of voles available in peak years than in low ones.},

	abstract = {The generalist predation hypothesis predicts that the functional responses of generalist predator species should be quicker than those of specialist predators and have a regulating effect on vole populations. New interpretations of their role in temperate ecosystems have, however, reactivated a debate suggesting generalist predators may have a destabilizing effect under certain conditions (e.g. landscape homogeneity, low prey diversity, temporary dominance of 1 prey species associated with a high degree of dietary specialization). We studied a rich predator community dominated by generalist carnivores (Martes spp., Vulpes vulpes, Felis catus) over a 6 yr period in farmland and woodland in France. The most frequent prey were small rodents (mostly Microtus arvalis, a grassland species, and Apodemus spp., a woodland species). Alternative prey were diverse and dominated by lagomorphs (Oryctolagus cuniculus, Lepus europeus). We detected a numerical response among specialist carnivores but not among generalist predators. The dietary responses of generalist predators were fairly complex and most often dependent on variation in density of at least 1 prey species. These results support the generalist predation hypothesis. We document a switch to alternative prey, an increase of diet diversity, and a decrease of diet overlap between small and medium-sized generalists during the low density phase of M. arvalis. In this ecosystem, the high density phases of small mammal species are synchronous and cause a temporary specializing of several generalist predator species. This rapid functional response may indicate the predominant role of generalists in low amplitude population cycles of voles observed in some temperate areas.},

	abstract = {Beginning with Emlen (1966) and MacArthur and Pianka (1966) and extending through the last ten years, several authors have sought to predict the foraging behavior of animals by means of mathematical models. These models are very similar,in that they all assume that the fitness of a foraging animal is a function of the efficiency of foraging measured in terms of some "currency" (Schoener, 1971) -usually energy- and that natural selection has resulted in animals that forage so as to maximize this fitness. As a result of these similarities, the models have become known as "optimal foraging models"; and the theory that embodies them, "optimal foraging theory." The situations to which optimal foraging theory has been applied, with the exception of a few recent studies, can be divided into the following four categories: (1) choice by an animal of which food types to eat (i.e., optimal diet); (2) choice of which patch type to feed in (i.e., optimal patch choice); (3) optimal allocation of time to different patches; and (4) optimal patterns and speed of movements. In this review we discuss each of these categories separately, dealing with both the theoretical developments and the data that permit tests of the predictions. The review is selective in the sense that we emphasize studies that either develop testable predictions or that attempt to test predictions in a precise quantitative manner. We also discuss what we see to be some of the future developments in the area of optimal foraging theory and how this theory can be related to other areas of biology. Our general conclusion is that the simple models so far formulated are supported are supported reasonably well by available data and that we are optimistic about the value both now and in the future of optimal foraging theory. We argue, however, that these simple models will requre much modification, espicially to deal with situations that either cannot easily be put into one or another of the above four categories or entail currencies more complicated that just energy.},

	abstract = {An understanding of the factors governing sciurid abundance in the Pacific Northwest is essential for prescribing forest management practices for second-growth forests where recovery of Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis) populations and enhancement of biodiversity are objectives. We compared results of companion studies of sciurids in western Washington and Oregon and examined patterns of abundance in relation to habitat elements on the Olympic Peninsula to elucidate governing factors and make recommendations for forest management. Regional contrasts show that Glaucomys sabrinus and Tamias townsendii in Douglas-fir forests in Oregon are 4 times more abundant than in western hemlock forests in Washington, and dietaries of Glaucomys, and the fungal communities that provide its food, are more diverse in Oregon than in Washington. Glaucomys sabrinus in old forests are 2 times more abundant than in young, managed forests without old-forest legacies (large live trees, large snags and large, decaying fallen trees); populations in young forests with old-forest legacies and with understory development may equal those in old growth. On the Olympic Peninsula, Glaucomys sabrinus abundance can be predicted by density of large snags and abundance of ericaceous shrubs. At least seven large snags/ha and well-distributed patches of dense shrubs (cover within patches {\textgreater}24\% and patches covering 40\% of the total area) are necessary for high densities of Glaucomys sabrinus. Abundance of Tamias townsendii reflects size of dominant tree and well-developed understories. Abundance of Tamiasciurus douglasii seems to reflect territoriality in concordance with food supply and was greatest where Glaucomys and Tamias were low in abundance. Patterns of abundance of the sciurids in old- and managed forests suggests that silvicultural manipulation of vegetation and creative snag or den-tree management could be used in a management strategy to accelerate the development of Spotted Owl habitat in areas where old growth is lacking.},

In Southeast Alaska, densities were the highest reported for the species, populations were not as closely linked to old-forest attributes, and individuals had a more diverse diet that was less dependent on mycophagy. Pacific Northwest communities are comprised of several arboreal rodents; Southeast Alaska has a depauperate mammal fauna. I hypothesized that Southeast Alaska populations had a broader realized niche because of competitive release. The red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) is the only other arboreal squirrel and it is absent from the southern outer islands of Southeast Alaska's Alexander Archipelago. I compared demography and body mass of G. sabrinus on Prince of Wales Island to a population in sympatry with T. hudsonicus on a separate island (Mitkof). Home ranges were larger and population density, breeding female density, and juvenile recruitment of G. sabrinus were all lower in sympatry with T. hudsonicus. In a companion study, G. sabrinus on Prince of Wales Island used cavities for denning relatively more frequently than in sympatry with T. hudsonicus on Mitkof Island. Female G. sabrinus depend on cavities for natal dens, and breeding female and population densities are positively correlated with large snag or tree density. The presence of T. hudsonicus may influence G. sabrinus populations by limiting availability of cavities. Furthermore, variation in vertebrate assemblages among islands may influence realized niches of resident species, which manifest unique demographic profiles compared to populations of different ecological communities.},

	abstract = {Compared to other birds, most raptors take large prey for their size, and feeding bouts are extended. However, ingestion rate has largely been overlooked as a constraint in raptors′ foraging and breeding ecology. We measured ingestion rate by offering avian and mammalian prey to eighteen wild raptors temporarily kept in captivity, representing seven species and three orders. Ingestion rate was higher for small than for large prey, higher for mammalian than for avian prey, higher for large than for small raptors, and higher for wide-gaped than for narrow-gaped raptors. Mammalian prey were ingested faster by raptors belonging to species with mainly mammals in their diet than by raptors with mainly birds in their diet, but the drop in ingestion rate with increasing prey size was more rapid for the former than for the latter. We argue that the separate sex roles found in raptors, i.e. the male hunting and the female feeding the young, is a solution of the conflict between the prolonged feeding bouts at the nest, and the benefit of rapid resumption of hunting in general, and rapid return to the previous capture site in particular (the prey size hypothesis). Thus, the sex roles differ more when prey takes longer to feed, i.e. from insects to mammals to birds. We then argue that the reversed sexual size dimorphism in raptors, i.e. smaller males than females, results from a conflict between the benefit of being small during breeding to capture the smallest items with the highest ingestion rate among these agile prey types (mammals and bird), and the benefit of being large outside the breeding season to ensure survival by being able to include large items in the diet when small items are scarce (the ingestion rate hypothesis). This hypothesis explains the observed variation in reversed sexual size dimorphism among raptors in relation to size and type of prey, i.e. increasing RSD from insects to mammals to birds as prey.},

	abstract = {Most raptors take large prey for their size compared to other birds, but tear the prey apart into small morsels before swallowing. Little is known about how the efficiency of this prey handling varies among raptors, and how it relates to their feeding niches, diets and gape dimensions. We offered 202 mammalian and 224 avian prey items to 37 wild raptors kept temporarily in captivity, representing ten species and three orders. Feeding efficiency was measured as the proportion of a prey item that was ingested. The proportion of a prey item ingested was larger for mammalian than for avian prey, declined with prey size, increased with raptor size, and was larger for typical vole feeders (with shorter and wider bills) than typical bird feeders (with longer and narrower bills). The proportion of a prey item ingested was not related to raptor sex when controlling for focal raptor body mass. The probability that the head of a prey was ingested was higher if the prey was a mammal than if it was a bird, whereas the opposite was the case for the entrails of a prey. The results suggest that the traditional use of prey remains to estimate raptor diets may lead to severe biases, the magnitude of which would depend on prey type and size, raptor sex, species and order, and raptor feeding niche. Failure to correct for uneaten remains of a prey would lead to overestimating the profitability of large prey, and in particular of large avian prey. The results are consistent with the idea that vole feeders can afford to have a well-developed digestive tract, and thus swallow prey in large pieces, because they pounce on prey from above. Bird feeders, however, must ingest food in smaller pieces because they have smaller guts as a result of selection to keep the body mass low to capture agile prey.},

However, there is no analysis investigating how systematic the error is in relation to prey size, abundance, species or method used. In this study we compared the diet composition of the Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and the Buzzards (the Common Buzzard Buteo buteo and the Rough-legged Buzzard B. lagopus) in northern Finland obtained indirectly (by collection of prey remains and pellets) and by direct methods (using a movie camera and a video recording system). In order to investigate the relationship between these two types of diet data more generally, we combined our own material and some published original data. Video and film images allowed us to identify according to class or family level most of the prey items delivered to the nests during the surveillance sessions, but identification according to genus or species level often was difficult. We found that small prey items were underestimated in remains as compared to large prey items. However, when none of the prey delivered to the nest is in large numbers, prey remains give fairly reliable idea of the real diet.},

Mean numbers of nestlings fledged was 6.42 for 12 woodland and edge species in Kansas, 4.33 for 8 species in lower Sonoran desert habitat in Arizona, 2.36 for 6 species in humid forest and second-growth habitats in Costa Rica, and 4.80 for 9 species in a desert scrub habitat in Ecuador. The data were analyzed by multiple correlation and stepwise multiple regression to determine the contribution of the variables to variation in the number of young fledged from one species to another in each locality. Variations in season length, clutch size, and breeding success were important components in variation in numbers of young fledged in Kansas, but length of nest cycle, being positively correlated with both clutch size and nest success, had the strongest correlation with the number of young fledged. In Arizona and Costa Rica, variation in breeding success held the key to predicting variation in number of young fledged, whereas in Ecuador season length and clutch size were the critical variables. The analyses suggest that data on production of young and the factors that cause production to vary from one species to another would add immensely to our understanding of the population ecology of birds.},

	abstract = {ABSTR ½T.--Numerous studies of predatory birds worldwide report dietary proportions based on analyses of large numbers of pellets or prey remains. Such analyses are often severely biased, hence strictly unquantifiable, because some prey remains are more conspicuous or persistent than others. We investigated this bias for the bird- and micromammal-eating African Marsh Harrier (Circus ranivorus), using an essentially independent measure of diet, observed prey deliveries to the nest. Comparisons of the frequency of occurrence showed that bird prey, particularly large wetland species, were over-represented almost threefold among remains. Micromammals were under-represented about 1.5-fold, while fish, frogs and eggs were marginally over-represented. Analyses using pellets were also biased but in the opposite direction to that of remains. We show that by combining pellets and prey remains (collected with equal effort), accurate estimates of overall diet can be achieved. This was verified using month by month comparisons of micromammals, in which proportions derived from pellets and remains never differed by more than 10\% from those established from direct observations.},

	abstract = {Investigating food-limitation in generalist predators is difficult, because they can switch to alternative prey, when one of their staple prey becomes scarce. Apart from data on the dynamics of the predator population, a robust study requires: (i) a documentation of the predator's entire prey base; and (ii) an experimental or natural situation, where profitable dietary shifts are impossible, because several preferred prey species decline simultaneously. Here, we provide a detailed description of how food-supply has limited a generalist avian top predator, the northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis. In our study area, populations of several principal goshawk prey species crashed simultaneously during 1975-2000, whereas other extrinsic factors remained essentially unchanged. The breeding and non-breeding segments of the local goshawk population declined markedly, associated with a significant increase in nest failures. Brood size of successful pairs remained unaffected by changes in prey availability. Breeding recruitment ceased at a time when potential replacement birds ('floaters') were still present, providing a rare empirical demonstration of an 'acceptance threshold' in raptor territory choice. To investigate how goshawk diet changed in response to varying food-supplies, we make novel use of an analytical tool from biodiversity research-'abundance-biomass-comparison curves' (ABC curves). With increasing levels of food-stress, the dominance of principal prey species in the diet decreased, and the number of small-bodied prey species increased, as did intra-guild predation. Our finding that breeder and non-breeder segments declined in concert is unexpected. Our results carry the management implication that, in food-limited raptor populations, externally induced breeder mortality can rapidly depress population size, as losses are no longer buffered when floaters reject breeding opportunities.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss, overexploitation, and numerous other stressors have caused global declines in apex predators. This “trophic downgrading” has generated widespread concern because of the fundamental role that apex predators can play in ecosystem functioning, disease regulation, and biodiversity maintenance. In attempts to combat declines, managers have conducted reintroductions, imposed stricter harvest regulations, and implemented protected areas. We suggest that full recovery of viable apex predator populations is currently the exception rather than the rule. We argue that, in addition to well-known considerations, such as continued exploitation and slow life histories, there are several underappreciated factors that complicate predator recoveries. These factors include three challenges. First, a priori identification of the suite of trophic interactions, such as resource limitation and competition that will influence recovery can be difficult. Second, defining and accomplishing predator recovery in the context of a dynamic ecosystem requires an appreciation of the timing of recovery, which can determine the relative density of apex predators and other predators and therefore affect competitive outcomes. Third, successful recovery programs require designing adaptive sequences of management strategies that embrace key environmental and species interactions as they emerge. Consideration of recent research on food web modules, alternative stable states, and community assembly offer important insights for predator recovery efforts and restoration ecology more generally. Foremost among these is the importance of a social-ecological perspective in facilitating a long-lasting predator restoration while avoiding unintended consequences.
Variable life histories, species interactions, and historical contingency underlie why some predators recover and others do not.

Nest-site selection was not associated with prey abundance; however, females initiated laying earlier on territories with higher prey abundance. Kestrels were more likely to choose nest boxes with unobstructed entrances and in recently harvested forests and laid clutches of lower volume in forests with a heavier deciduous component. Nestling mass (females) was greater in boxes at the forest edge and on jack pine, and feather lengths (males) were greater in nests on trees in poor health. We discuss the importance of these features for provisioning and nest vigilance and propose that kestrels in our area make decisions based on interactions occurring at scales intermediate to the landscape and territory levels.},

	abstract = {We examined associations between annual reproduction and climate for 6 populations of individually marked northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) in Washington and Oregon. We used an information-theoretical approach and mixed models to evaluate statistical models representing a priori hypotheses about the effects of weather and climate on reproduction. Reproduction was higher for adult than subadult owls and declined as the proportion of spotted owl territories with barred owl (Strix varia) detections increased. Similar to other spotted owl studies, we found that reproduction was negatively associated with cold, wet winters and nesting seasons at 3 of 6 study areas. In addition, we identified new relationships between reproduction, annual precipitation, storms, and regional climate cycles. For 3 of 6 areas, we found a quadratic relation between precipitation (rain and snow) and reproduction, with the number of young fledged per pair per year declining as precipitation in the previous year deviated from average levels. A meta-analysis conducted across all 6 areas indicated that reproduction at the regional level had a quadratic association with total winter snowfall in the preceding winter and was positively related to temperatures during the previous summer and fall. The amount of annual variation in reproduction accounted for by weather and climate varied widely across the 6 areas (4–79\%), whereas variation in weather and climate across owl territories accounted for little of the spatial variation in reproduction (0–4\%). Our results suggest that across the range of the species climate factors affecting prey abundance may have a greater effect on reproduction than direct effects of weather on nestlings. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {Efforts to preserve biological diversity must focus increasingly at the ecosystem level because of the immense number of species, the majority of which are currently unknown. An ecosystem approach is also the only way to conserve processes and habitats (such as forest canopies, belowground habitats, and hyporheic zones) that, with their constituent species, are poorly known. Continued concern with species is essential, however. Landscape—level issues also need much greater attention. Designing an appropriate system of habitat reserves is one landscape—level concern. Understanding and appropriately manipulating the landscape matrix is at least equal in importance to reserves issues, however, since the matrix itself is important in maintaining diversity, influences the effectiveness of reserves, and controls landscape connectivity.},

Increasingly, vertebrates are used to assess population trends and habitat quality for other species. In this paper we review the conceptual bases, assumptions, and published guidelines for selection and use of vertebrates as ecological indicators. We conclude that an absence of precise definitions and procedures, confounded criteria used to select species, and discordance with ecological literature severely weaken the effectiveness and credibility of using vertebrates as ecological indicators. In many cases the use of ecological indicator species is inappropriate, but when necessary, the following recommendations will make their use more rigorous: (1) clearly state assessment goals, (2) use indicators only when other assessment options are unavailable, (3) choose indicator species by explicitly defined criteria that are in accord with assessment goals, (4) include all species that fulfill stated selection criteria (5) know the biology of the indicator in detail, and treat the indicator as a formal estimator in conceptual and statistical models, (6) identify and define sources of subjectivity when selecting monitoring and intetpreting indicator species, (7) submit assessment design, methods of data collection and statistical analysis, interpretations, and recommendations to peer review and (8) direct research at developing an overall strategy for monitoring wildlife that accounts for natural variability in population attributes and incorporates concepts from landscape ecology.},

	abstract = {The 1994 Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) shifted federal lands management  from a focus on timber production to ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation. The plan established a network of conservation reserves and an ecosystem management strategy on {\textasciitilde}10 million hectares from northern California to Washington State, USA, within the range of the federally threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina). Several subsequent assessments—and 20 years of data from monitoring programs established under the plan—have demonstrated the effectiveness of this reserve network and ecosystem management approach in making progress toward attaining many of the plan’s conservation and ecosystem management goals. This paper (1) showcases the fundamental conservation biology and ecosystem management principles underpinning the NWFP as a case study for managers interested in large-landscape conservation; and (2) recommends improvements to the plan’s strategy in response to unprecedented climate change and land-use threats. Twenty years into plan implementation, however, the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, under pressure for increased timber harvest, are retreating from conservation measures. We believe that federal agencies should instead build on the NWFP to ensure continuing success in the Pacific Northwest. We urge federal land managers to (1) protect all remaining late-successional/old-growth forests; (2) identify climate refugia for at-risk species; (3) maintain or increase stream buffers and landscape connectivity; (4) decommission and repair failing roads to improve water quality; (5) reduce fire risk in fire-prone tree plantations; and (6) prevent logging after fires in areas of high conservation value. In many respects, the NWFP is instructive for managers considering similar large-scale conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Although species with large area requirements are sometimes used as umbrella species, their general utility as conservation tools is uncertain. We surveyed the species diversity of birds, butterflies, carabids, and forest-floor plants in forest sites across an area (1600 km2) in which we delineated large breeding home ranges of Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis). We tested whether protection of the home ranges could serve as an effective umbrella to protect sympatric species of the four taxa. We also used an empirical habitat model of occupancy of home range to examine mechanisms by which the Northern Goshawk acts as an umbrella species. Among species richness, abundance, and species composition of the four taxa, only abundance and species composition of birds differed between sites located inside and outside home ranges, which was due to greater abundance of bird species that were prey of Northern Goshawks inside the home ranges. Thus, although home range indicated areas with high abundance of certain bird prey species, it was not effective as an indicator of the species diversity of all four taxa. We also did not find any difference in species richness, abundance, and species composition between sites predicted as occupied and unoccupied using the habitat model. In contrast, when we selected sites on the basis of each habitat variable in the model, habitat variables that selected sites either in agricultural or forested landscapes encompassed sites with high species richness or particular species composition. This result suggests that the low performance of the Northern Goshawk as an umbrella species is due to this species' preference for habitat in both agricultural and forested landscapes. Species that can adjust to changes in habitat conditions may not act as effective umbrella species despite having large home ranges.},

	abstract = {Geographical gradients in the stability of cyclic populations of herbivores and their predators may relate to the degree of specialization of predators. However, such changes are usually associated with transition from specialist to generalist predator species, rather than from geographical variation in dietary breadth of specialist predators. Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) populations undergo cyclic fluctuations in northern parts of their range, but cycles are either greatly attenuated or lost altogether in the southern boreal forest where prey diversity is higher. We tested the influence of prey specialization on population cycles by measuring the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in lynx and their prey, estimating the contribution of hares to lynx diet across their range, and correlating this degree of specialization to the strength of their population cycles. Hares dominated the lynx diet across their range, but specialization on hares decreased in southern and western populations. The degree of specialization correlated with cyclic signal strength indicated by spectral analysis of lynx harvest data, but overall variability of lynx harvest (the standard deviation of natural-log-transformed harvest numbers) did not change significantly with dietary specialization. Thus, as alternative prey became more important in the lynx diet, the fluctuations became decoupled from a regular cycle but did not become less variable. Our results support the hypothesis that alternative prey decrease population cycle regularity but emphasize that such changes may be driven by dietary shifts among dominant specialist predators rather than exclusively through changes in the predator community.},

Their functional and numerical responses to changes in prey density, and their influence on small rodent numbers, are discussed. The shape of the functional response curve of the predators may be important for the dynamics of the predator-prey system. Generalists with access to alternative prey tend to stabilize rodent numbers, as do migrating specialists, whereas resident specialists may be destabilizing. Field studies on cyclic rodent populations point to the importance of predation during and after the decline phase, and indicate that predation may increase the amplitude and prolong the period of the cycles. Other studies indicate a strong influence of predation on rodent numbers in areas with a diversified prey and predator fauna. /// Описано хищничество на популяциях мелких грызунов.

	abstract = {Fluctuating prey populations and their effects on avian predator population dynamics have been studied particularly at high latitudes, where prey populations, especially microtines, are known to be cyclic; raptors show both numerical and functional responses to variations in their prey. In this paper, we investigate the response of a migratory raptor (Montagu's Harrier, Circus pygargus) to variations in abundance of its main prey (common vole, Microtus arvalis) in France. We document multiannual fluctuation in the abundance of common voles. The numerical response of Montagu's Harrier to this variable food supply was studied using breeding parameters (breeding density, breeding phenology, and various measures of breeding success). Breeding density and mean clutch size were strongly correlated with spring vole abundance, whereas mean brood size at fledging was correlated positively with summer vole abundance. The mechanism involved in the numerical response of Montagu's Harrier indicates that dispersal and colonization by yearlings may be more important than natality per se. Pellets collected between 1986 and 1997 were used to determine the functional response of Montagu's Harrier to variations in vole abundance. In terms of biomass, Montagu's Harrier diet consisted mainly of voles (33.7–86.6\%, between 1986 and 1997). Vole biomass in pellets was closely related to vole abundance estimated by trapping. A type II functional response was detected, with satiation at high prey density, as the shapes of many relationships between breeding parameters and vole abundance were more curvilinear than linear. Our results fit the pattern of relationships between predators and cyclic prey found in Fennoscandia, in which specialist predators show a strong numerical response, although at such a temperate latitude, a more pronounced functional response might have been expected.},

	abstract = {(1) Two kinds of predation affecting the dynamics of microtine rodent populations have received increasing attention in recent years. It has been suggested that specialist mammalian predators (small mustelids) maintain or at least significantly contribute to the regular multi-annual cycles of rodent populations in northern Europe. Generalist predators (foxes, common buzzards, cats, etc.) are assumed to stabilize rodent populations in more southern localities. (2) Combining the two kinds of predation in the same predator-prey model demonstrates that the generalist predators have a stabilizing effect on a cycle driven by specialist predators. (3) In the model, the ratio of the maximum over the minimum prey population size and the length of the prey cycle decrease with increasing numbers of generalist predators. Sufficiently large numbers of generalist predators convert the limit cycle to a stable equilibrium point. (4) The numbers of generalist predators greatly increase from north to south in Fennoscandia. In agreement with the model predictions, the ratio of the maximum over the minimum rodent density decreases by an order of magnitude, and the length of the cycle decreases from 5 to 3 years, from the seventieth to the sixtieth parallel. There is no clear multiannual cycle below 60 degrees N.},

	abstract = {1 We studied chick diet in a known-age, sexed population of a long-lived seabird, the Brünnich's guillemot (Uria lomvia), over 15 years (N = 136; 1993–2007) and attached time–depth–temperature recorders to examine foraging behaviour in multiple years (N = 36; 2004–07). 2 Adults showed specialization in prey fed to offspring, described by multiple indices calculated over 15 years: 27\% of diet diversity was attributable to among-individual variation (within-individual component of total niche width = 0·73); average similarity of an individual's diet to the overall diet was 65\% (mean proportional similarity between individuals and population = 0·65); diet was significantly more specialized than expected for 70\% of individuals (mean likelihood = 0.53). These indices suggest higher specialization than the average for an across-taxa comparison of 49 taxa. 3 Foraging behaviour varied along three axes: flight time, dive depth and dive shape. Individuals showed specialized individual foraging behaviour along each axis. These foraging strategies were reflected in the prey type delivered to their offspring and were maintained over scales of hours to years. 4 Specialization in foraging behaviour and diet was greater over short time spans (hours, days) than over long time spans (years). Regardless of sex or age, the main component of variation in foraging behaviour and chick diet was between individuals. 5 Plasma stable isotope values were similar across years, within a given individual, and variance was low relative to that expected from prey isotope values, suggesting adult diet specialized across years. Stable isotope values were similar among individuals that fed their nestlings similar prey items and there was no difference in trophic level between adults and chicks. We suggest that guillemots specialize on a single foraging strategy regardless of whether chick-provisioning and self-feeding. With little individual difference in body mass and physiology, specialization likely represents learning and memorizing optimal feeding locations and behaviours. 6 There was no difference in survival or reproductive success between specialists and generalists, suggesting these are largely equivalent strategies in terms of evolutionary fitness, presumably because different strategies were advantageous at different levels of prey abundance or predictability. The development of individual specialization may be an important precursor to diversification among seabirds.},

	abstract = {Field observations of discriminatory feeding behavior of squirrels indicate that in the process of maximizing their own feeding efficiency squirrels act as selective agents on several characteristics of plant reproduction. Calorimetric measurements of the energy content of plant reproductive organs confirm the evolutionary effects of discriminatory feeding by squirrels. The reproductive characteristics of conifers which are affected include several details of cone anatomy, the number of seeds per cone, the time at which cones shed their seeds, the thickness of seed coats, and annual fluctuations in the size of cone crops. A prolonged evolutionary interaction between rodent-like, arboreal mammals and the reproductive organs of the modern genera in the family Pinaceae is consistent with the fossil record. A general analysis of selective pressure influencing terrestrial plant reproduction indicates that seed eaters could have a marked influence on the evolution of plant reproduction. Among the interrelated selective pressures that influence the coevolution of conifers and squirrels, the physical environment is the independent variable. The effect of one predator feeding on two species of prey is the divergent evolution of defense mechanisms in the two prey species. However, one species of predator can cause convergent evolution in the pattern of variation in the production of prey, which may also be considered a defense mechanism.},

	abstract = {Climate change is projected to increase fire severity and frequency in the boreal forest, but it could also directly affect post-fire recruitment processes by impacting seed production, germination, and seedling growth and survival. We reviewed current knowledge regarding the effects of high temperatures and water deficits on post-fire recruitment processes of four major tree species (Picea mariana, Pinus banksiana, Populus tremuloides and Betula papyrifera) in order to anticipate the effects of climate change on forest recovery following fire in the boreal biome. We also produced maps of future vulnerability of post-fire recruitment by combining tree distributions in Canada with projections of temperature, moisture index and fire regime for the 2041-2070 and 2071-2100 periods. Although our review reveals that information is lacking for some regeneration stages, it highlights the response variability to climate conditions between species. The recruitment process of black spruce is likely to be the most affected by rising temperatures and water deficits, but more tolerant species are also at risk of being impacted by projected climate conditions. Our maps suggest that in eastern Canada, tree species will be vulnerable mainly to projected increases in temperature, while forests will be affected mostly by droughts in western Canada. Conifer-dominated forests are at risk of becoming less productive than they currently are, and eventually , timber supplies from deciduous species-dominated forests could also decrease. Our vulnerability maps are useful for prioritizing areas where regeneration monitoring efforts and adaptive measures could be developed.},

	abstract = {Ecology Letters (2012) 15: 365–377 Abstract Many studies in recent years have investigated the effects of climate change on the future of biodiversity. In this review, we first examine the different possible effects of climate change that can operate at individual, population, species, community, ecosystem and biome scales, notably showing that species can respond to climate change challenges by shifting their climatic niche along three non-exclusive axes: time (e.g. phenology), space (e.g. range) and self (e.g. physiology). Then, we present the principal specificities and caveats of the most common approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global and sub-continental scales and we synthesise their results. Finally, we highlight several challenges for future research both in theoretical and applied realms. Overall, our review shows that current estimates are very variable, depending on the method, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered. Yet, the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity, with the worst-case scenarios leading to extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass extinction in the history of the earth.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem-based management is the management system being applied to 6.4 million hectares of the coast of British Columbia, Canada, an area referred to as the Great Bear Rainforest. This approach, intended to manage for ecosystem integrity and community wellbeing, is similar in many respects to ecosystem management approaches elsewhere. However, several novel elements are involved in application of ecosystem-based management on British Columbia's coast: shifts in power that have led to increased aboriginal control and the formation of coalitions between groups that were formerly in opposition; development of explicit models relating management strategies to land-use objectives and separating knowledge from values; use of ecological thresholds and natural variability to establish management targets. Current management is based on transitional targets that differ from science-based targets. Many challenges remain in moving to full implementation of ecosystem-based management, including the difficulties involved in moving from one management model to a fundamentally different one, limited resources for implementation, dealing with complex systems, the lack of freely available multi-disciplinary data, and the difficulty of bringing concepts of uncertainty and risk into public policy discussions in a transparent manner.},
