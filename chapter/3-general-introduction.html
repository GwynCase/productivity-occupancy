<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> General Introduction</h1>
<p>Once valued primarily for high timber yields, temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest are now managed with increased emphasis on the conservation of biodiversity <span class="citation">(Thomas et al. 2006)</span>. Among the drivers of this shift are declining populations of species whose life histories depend on old-growth forests. Some of these species have been placed under federal, provincial, or state protection: among others, the marbled murrelet (<em>Brachyramphus marmoratus</em>) is protected under the Species at Risk Act in Canada <span class="citation">(COSEWIC 2014)</span><!-- you have the old one from 2012 but it looks like there's a new one --> and the coastal population of the pacific marten (<em>Martes caurina</em>) is protected under the Endangered Species Act in the United States <span class="citation">(Wildlife Service 2020)</span>. Management under these types of legislation is typically reactive and focuses on conserving each imperiled species on a case-by-case basis <span class="citation">(Simberloff 1998)</span>. This approach has been widely criticized for failing to provide management for wider ecosystems, including the very ecosystems on which the imperiled species depend <span class="citation">(Lambeck 1997)</span>. Alternatively, focusing on the broader scales of landscapes or ecosystems should preserve the ecosystem processes and services on which wild species and humans alike depend <span class="citation">(Franklin 1993 <!-- plus something for ecosystem services-->)</span>. Yet ecosystem-based management is itself beset by numerous practical, theoretical, and even philosophical challenges which have made it difficult to implement <span class="citation">(Lambeck 1997, Simberloff 1998)</span>.</p>
<!-- Simberloff 1998: "It is reactive, rather than proactive, and explicitly targets species and populations, in that it specifically provides protection for species (and, in certain instances, some populations rather than entire species) that are already felt to be doomed to extinction if new action is not taken to redress their decline." -->
<!-- Lambeck 1997: "Species-based approaches have been criticized on the grounds that they do not provide whole-landscape solutions to conservation problems, that they cannot be conducted at a rate sufficient to deal with the urgency of the threats, and that they consume a disproportionate amount of conservation funding." -->
<p>Managers have often turned to surrogate species as a solution for the dilemma posed by the single-species and ecosystem-based management debate. At the core of the surrogate species concept is the belief that the requirements or wellbeing of a single species, or a small suite of species, can stand in for the needs and health of numerous co-occurring species or entire ecosystems (Caro 2010). Numerous variations and conflicting definitions are present in the literature, but the original concept may be that of the <em>indicator species</em>. The presence and population size of an indicator species is believed to reflect ecosystem processes or the populations of other species (Landres et al. 1988). <!-- Under this model, the indicator species itself may not be of conservation concern, but is strongly correlated with species and ecosystems which are. -->Perhaps more widespread than indicator species is the <em>umbrella species</em> concept. Protections which benefit umbrella species–typically wide-ranging habitat specialists–are assumed to confer protection to co-occurring species with smaller ranges and less restrictive habitat requirements (Roberge &amp; Angelstam 2004, Seddon &amp; Leech 2008). A related concept is the <em>flagship species</em>, a species whose protection, like an umbrella species, confers benefit on other species, but which is selected for its charisma and ability to serve as a rallying point for conservation (Andelman &amp; Fagan 2000). These concepts all attempt to extend the relative simplicity of single-species methods to achieve the promise of ecosystem-based management <span class="citation">(Lambeck 1997)</span>.</p>
<!-- Roberge & Angelstam 2004: "A potentially consensual alternative could be a species whose conservation confers protection to a large number of naturally co-occurring species."

"It hinges on the assumption that providing enough space for species with large area requirements will also shelter a whole suite of species with more modest spatial needs." -->
<!-- Seddon & Leech 2008: "It has been suggested that the home range size of an umbrella species should be large in comparison to sympatric species to ensure that the habitat requirements of other co-occurring species are met." 

"Habitat specialists are considered ideal umbrella species because their area requirements may be larger than those of generalists"-->
<!-- Lambeck 1997: "The challenge then is to find an efficient means of meeting the needs of all species without studying each one individually. In order to overcome this dilemma, proponents of sing-species studies have developed the concept of umbrella species." -->
<p>No species better embodies the challenges of managing forest species and ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest than the northern spotted owl (<em>Strix occidentalis caurina</em>). The spotted owl is strongly associated with old-growth temperate rainforests <span class="citation">(Forsman et al. 2004)</span> and has at various points been proposed as an indicator <span class="citation">(Gutiérrez and Carey 1985)</span>, an umbrella <span class="citation">(Tracy and Brussard 1994)</span>, and a flagship species<!-- () --> for this ecosystem. In the late 1980s, public outcry and litigation in the United States led to the development of a spotted owl conservation strategy concurrent with the species’ listing as threatened under the Endangered Species Act <span class="citation">(Thomas et al. 2006)</span>. This single-species plan rapidly expanded to include other species, particularly the marbled murrelet and several salmon stocks, and ultimately evolved into the Northwest Forest Plan. The Northwest Forest Plan remained rooted in spotted owl management, but also included protections for watersheds, monitoring of rare species, and a sustainable annual timber harvest <span class="citation">(DellaSala and Williams 2006)</span>. Not all the Northwest Forest Plan’s goals have been achieved–notably, spotted owl and marbled murrelet populations have continued to decline, although at a slower rate–and some parts of the plan have been eroded under subsequent presidential administrations <span class="citation">(DellaSala et al. 2015)</span>. Yet the Northwest Forest Plan remains a powerful example of an ecosystem-based management plan with a single species at its core.</p>
<p>The story of the northern goshawk (<em>Accipiter gentilis</em>) in North America parallels that of the spotted owl. Goshawks are found in boreal forests across the continent and range as far south as the high-elevation forests of the American Southwest. Two subspecies (<em>A. g. atricapillus</em> and <em>A. g. laingi</em>) are widely recognized and a third (<em>A. g. apache</em>) is acknowledged by some authors <span class="citation">(Squires et al. 2020)</span>. Goshawks are not associated with old-growth forest to the same degree as the spotted owl, but do show a clear preference for extensive tracts of mature forest with large-diameter trees and closed canopies <span class="citation">(Andersen et al. 2005, Squires and Kennedy 2006)</span>. Like the spotted owl, goshawks have been proposed as a flagship <span class="citation">(Sergio et al. 2006)</span>, an indicator<!--()-->, and an umbrella species <span class="citation">(Ozaki et al. 2006)</span>. In the American Southwest, alarms were sounded over the impact of timber harvest on northern goshawks at the same time the Northwest Forest Plan was developing in the Pacific Northwest <span class="citation">(Crocker-Bedford 1990)</span>. Decades of litigation failed to result in listing the southwestern population (proposed subspecies <em>apache</em>) under the Endangered Species Act, but <!--it has been classified as a sensitive species since 1982 and--> a new management plan was eventually developed <!--under the National Forest Management Act in the 1990s --><span class="citation">(Peck 2000)</span>. This single-species management plan disallowed timber harvest near known goshawk nests and required a minimum amount of mature forest within the larger home range surrounding nests <span class="citation">(Reynolds et al. 1992)</span>. Notably, the plan also specified the inclusion of younger forest, small clearings, snags, and woody debris to provide habitat for eight important goshawk prey species. This recommendation was based on the assumption that goshawks are habitat generalists limited by the abundance, not the availability, of prey–an assumption which has been the subject of heated debate <span class="citation">(Greenwald et al. 2005, Reynolds et al. 2008)</span>. However, by incorporating multiple species, dynamic ecosystem processes, and human use, the goshawk management plan approaches the principles of ecosystem-based management and shows its potential to scale up to a more cohesive plan in the style of the Northwest Forest Plan <span class="citation">(Graham et al. 1994, Peck 2000)</span>.</p>
<p>In the Pacific Northwest, naturalists described a small, dark subspecies of goshawk unique to the coastal temperate rainforests of Haida Gwaii and Vancouver Island <span class="citation">(Taverner 1940)</span>. The size and plumage characteristics of <em>A. g. laingi</em> may be an adaptation the dark, dense forests the subspecies inhabits <span class="citation">(Ethier 1999)</span><!-- actually whaley & white --> and the agile avian prey believed to dominate its diet <span class="citation">(Penteriani et al. 2013, McClaren et al. 2015)</span>. The precise range of <em>laingi</em> is unclear; based on morphometrics, genetics, and ecosystem mapping, it is believed to extend along the west coast and islands of British Columbia, from Southeast Alaska south to Washington’s Olympic Peninsula <span class="citation">(Team 2008, Sonsthagen et al. 2012)</span>. In the portion of its range within the United States the <em>laingi</em> subspecies has no additional protections, but in Canada it is designated as Threatened by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). The <em>laingi</em> subspecies is further Red-listed by the British Columbia Conservation Data Centre and is an Identified Wildlife Species under the Forest Practices Code <span class="citation">(COSEWIC 2013)</span>. Existing management plans call for the creation of buffers around known goshawk nests and the maintenance of a minimum amount of mature forest within the larger home range, similar to the plan from the American Southwest <span class="citation">(McClaren et al. 2015, Agency 2018)</span>. However, plans do not include recommendations for providing habitat for goshawk prey species. To some extent this is due to the single-species nature of the plan, but it is also a result of several knowledge gaps. Goshawk managers have acknowledged that a landscape-scale plan would be superior to the current fine-scale plan, and ecosystem-based management has been implemented elsewhere in British Columbia, most notably the Great Bear Rainforest <span class="citation">(Price et al. 2009 <!--but can do better-->)</span>. Together these suggest an ecosystem-based approach incorporating the goshawk as a focal species may be possible for coastal rainforests elsewhere in British Columbia. Yet while <em>laingi</em> nesting habitat is relatively well documented, foraging behavior and habitat remain poorly understood. The knowledge gaps surrounding goshawk foraging ecology hinder current single-species and potential ecosystem-based management alike.</p>
<!-- Ethier 1999: "Whaley and White (1994) speculate that these combined morphological traits provide A. g. laingi with an enhanced agility for hunting and penetrating through the comparatively dense forests of Vancouver Island." -->
<!-- NGRT 2008: "However, managing A. gentilis laingi on a nest-by-nest basis is an ineffective management approach at a population scale because individuals have large breeding and winter home ranges and they build multiple nests within breeding areas throughout their lifetime. Additionally, A. gentilis laingi are difficult to detect and locating all nests within a breeding home range is virtually impossible because nests will fall out of trees over time and new nests will be constructed. The recovery team recommends addressing the management of A. gentilis laingi at a landscape or watershed level to ensure that suitable breeding, foraging, and wintering habitats exist throughout the landscape."-->
<p>My thesis attempts to fill one knowledge gap identified by the Northern Goshawk Recovery Team (NGRT) by providing basic ecological information regarding the breeding season diet of goshawks in coastal British Columbia <span class="citation">(Team 2008)</span>. The following chapter describes my research quantifying goshawk diet in coastal British Columbia and investigating potential links between dietary variation and goshawk reproductive success. The final chapter summarizes my results, describes the outcome of a pilot study of goshawk space-use, and discusses the implications of both for management and future research efforts.</p>
