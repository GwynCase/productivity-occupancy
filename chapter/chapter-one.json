		"abstract": "[A controversy exists in the Pacific Northwest of the United States between logging of old-growth coniferous forests and conservation of Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) populations. This species has a strong association with old-growth forests that also have economic value as timber. Research questions relevant to conservation of this species include how temporal trends in Northern Spotted Owl populations are influenced and how spatial configuration of old-growth forests affects these populations. To address these questions, we studied a population of marked Northern Spotted Owls on 95 territories in northwestern California from 1985 through 1994. We examined the magnitude of temporal and spatial variation in life history traits (survival, reproductive output, and recruitment), the effects of climate and landscape characteristics on temporal and spatial variation in these traits, respectively, and how this variation affected aspects of population dynamics. We used a components-of-variation analysis to partition sampling from process variation, and a model selection approach to estimate life history traits using capture-recapture and random-effects models. Climate explained most of the temporal variation in life history traits. Annual survival varied the least over time, whereas recruitment rate varied the most, suggesting a \"bet-hedging\" life history strategy for the owl. A forecast of annual rates of population change (λ), estimated from life history traits, suggested that Northern Spotted Owl populations may change solely due to climate influences, even with unchanging habitat conditions. In terms of spatial variation, annual survival on territories was positively associated both with amounts of interior old-growth forest and with length of edge between those forests and other vegetation types. Reproductive output was negatively associated with interior forest, but positively associated with edge between mature and old-growth conifer forest and other vegetation types. A gradient existed in territory-specific estimates of fitness derived from these life history estimates. This gradient suggested that a mosaic of older forest interspersed with other vegetation types promoted high fitness in Northern Spotted Owls. Habitat quality, as defined by fitness, appeared to buffer variation in annual survival but did not buffer reproductive output. We postulated that the magnitude of λ was determined by habitat quality, whereas variation of λ was influenced by recruitment and reproductive output. As habitat quality declines, variation in λ should become more pronounced.]",

		"abstract": "[In this paper, we use a modeling approach to explore the population regulatory consequences of individual choices for where to breed in heterogeneous environments. In contrast to standard models, we focus on individuals that interact only indirectly through their choices of breeding sites (i.e., individuals preempt the occupation of a breeding site by others when they choose to breed there). We consider the consequences of individuals choosing breeding sites either randomly or sequentially from best to worst. Our analysis shows that average per-capita fecundity of the population is independent of the number of occupied breeding sites of individuals choose sites at random and that variation in average per-capita fecundity increases as population size declines. In contrast, if individuals choose breeding sites sequentially from highest to lowest quality, then as population size increases average per-capita fecundity declines and variation in average per-capita fecundity increases. Consequently, aggregate population-level demographic rates can change in ways that generate population regulation, even when change in population size does not change the demographic performance of any individual on any particular breeding site. However, such regulation occurs only when individuals make adaptive choices of where to breed. Because variation in average per-capita fecundity decreases when population size declines, populations regulated in a site-dependent manner should be much less susceptible to the vicissitudes of small population size than those which choose breeding sites at random.]",

		"abstract": "[1. Territory quality may affect individual fitness and contribute to density-dependent reproduction, with repercussions on population regulation. We investigated the probable causes and population consequences of spatio-temporal variations in territory quality, measured by occupancy, in eight black kite Milvus migrans Boddaert populations, one of them studied for 10 years (Lake Lugano) and the rest for 4-5 years. 2. Over a period of years, the occupation rate of territories varied from a random pattern. Some territories were preferred while others were avoided. On return from migration, males and females settled earlier on high-occupancy territories. 3. The positive association between territory occupancy and breeding performance held in all years of study at Lake Lugano, and in six of seven tested populations. As a result, high-occupancy territories contributed most of the young produced by each population. 4. The occupation rate of the overall 225 territories was related positively to food availability and negatively to mortality risk, measured as proximity to the nearest eagle owl Bubo bubo Linnaeus nest. 5. At the population level, spatial variation in mean occupancy was positively correlated with spatial variation in mean productivity, suggesting that mean occupancy could be used as a measure of overall habitat quality and population performance. 6. In the Lake Lugano area, a higher proportion of low quality territories was occupied in years of higher density and annual productivity was related negatively to its coefficient of variation. However, annual productivity was not related significantly to the proportion of low quality territories occupied, so support for the theory of site-dependent population regulation was only partial. 7. In a review of 22 studies of territory occupancy in 17 species, occupancy always deviated from a random pattern in species in which it was tested and was always correlated with productivity and/or with some other measure of territory quality. Our results confirm the importance of prioritizing conservation of high quality territories. Occupancy may be a reliable method of quality assessment, especially for populations in which not all territories are always occupied, or for species in which checking occupancy is easier than finding nests.]",

		"abstract": "A Markovian modeling approach was used to explore territorial interactions among three forest raptors coexisting in a forested natural area in southeast Spain: the booted eagle (Hieraaetus pennatus), the common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis). Using field data collected over a period of 12 years, 11 annual transition matrices were built, considering four occupancy states for each territory. The model describes transitional processes (colonization, abandonment, replacement and persistence), permits temporal variations in the transition matrix to be tested, and simulates territorial occupation for a few subsequent years. Parameters for the species and community dynamics were described in terms of turnover times and damping ratio. A perturbation analysis was performed to simulate the effects of changes in the transition probabilities on the stable state distribution. Our results indicate the existence of a stable community, largely dominated by the booted eagles, and described by a time-invariant transition matrix. Despite the stability observed, the territorial system is highly dynamic, with frequent abandonment and colonization events, although interspecific territorial interactions (the replacement of one species by another) are uncommon. Consequently, the three species appear to follow relatively independent occupancy dynamics. Simulation of potential management actions showed that substantial increases in the number of territories occupied by the less common species (goshawk and buzzard) can only be attained if relatively large increases in their reoccupation and colonization rates are considered.",

		"abstract": "[This paper describes red squirrel population dynamics on two intensive study areas (Camp and Main) in mixed-forest types near Rochester, Alberta. It also examines local and regional population fluctuations, and their relationship to cone crops and weather factors. Adult red squirrel numbers on our study areas varied little from 1967 to 1968. Yearly differences in reproductive output were caused principally by changing ovulation and pregnancy rates. Mean litter size increased significantly from 3.4 in 1967 to 4.3 in 1968; while the per cent adult females breeding increased significantly from 67 to 88. A life-table analysis of age-ratio data estimated mean annual mortality among juveniles (postweaning) at 67%; and an adult mortality rate of 34% for yearlings and 61% for older cohorts. A time-specific estimate of adult mortality on the Camp study area during the year starting summer 1967 was 21%. Red squirrel territories appeared to be of two distinct types: (1) defended winter food caches which were subsequently abandoned during the summer, and (2) @'prime@' territories in which a specific area was defended year round. During the summers of 1967 and 1968, 31% and 26% of study-area adult populations occupied prime territories. The distribution of prime territories chiefly reflected the presence of mature seed-producing conifers, and hence a potential year-round food supply. Deciduous areas were particularly important in overwintering the juvenile cohort. Fur returns were used as population indices in determining synchrony and periodicity of red squirrel fluctuations. Fluctuations tend to occur synchronously over much of the Prairie Provinces. Furthermore, mean intervals between peak years in Alberta (2.6) and Saskatchewan (2.8) were significantly shorter than in random series of comparable length, while the 2.9-year mean interval in Manitoba approached significance. A statistically significant correlation was found between white spruce cone crops and red squirrel populations in Alberta as indexed by annual fur harvests. The negative correlation between cone crops in late summer and rainfall during summer of the preceding year was almost significant. This supported the widely held view that weather factors influence bud differentiation and hence determine the size of the following year's cone crop. Our contention that cone production may in this way provide a vehicle through which weather affects squirrel populations was supported by a number of statistically significant negative correlations between Alberta and Saskatchewan fur returns and the preceding year's summer rainfall. Such a mechanism would explain the observed widespread synchrony of population fluctuations, since extensive regional weather patterns could be involved.]",

Using mark-recapture techniques to estimate population demographics, we tested the hypotheses that populations of G. sabrinus and T. hudsonicus were limited by availability of food and that old-growth stands provided higher-quality habitat than second-growth stands. Populations were monitored on six study areas; two second-growth lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands (controls), two second-growth pine stands with food supplementation (treatments), and two old-growth lodgepole pine stands. Sunflower seeds were applied (20 kg ha-1 month-1) to treatment stands by helicopter in a uniform distribution for 3 summers, and mark-recapture of G. sabrinus and T. hudsonicus was initiated in the second summer of food supplementation. There were significantly more G. sabrinus and T. hudsonicus in treatment stands than in control stands. The mean density of G. sabrinus and T. hudsonicus in treatment stands was ca. 1.8 times greater than that in control stands. Estimates of population sizes for G. sabrinus in control stands were significantly lower than those in old-growth stands. Estimates of population sizes for T. hudsonicus in control and old-growth stands were not significantly different. Adult male G. sabrinus in control and treatment stands were significantly heavier than those in old-growth stands. Body mass for T. hudsonicus and the proportion of adults breeding, recruitment, and survival rates for G. sabrinus and T. hudsonicus did not vary among control, treatment, and old-growth stands. Consequently, populations of G. sabrinus and T. hudsonicus appeared to be limited by availability of food, but individuals did not appear to benefit from food supplementation. Second-growth stands were not suboptimal habitat for G. sabrinus and T. hudsonicus.]",

Age-specific survival and breeding (ASSAB) models were developed with data from 318 goshawks (Accipiter gentilis L.) fitted during 1980-7 on the Baltic island of Gotland with tail-mounted radio-tags. 2. Comparisons with recaptures and recoveries of 238 ringed juveniles without radio-tags detected no marking bias among hawks radio-tagged at nests, nor survival bias from tag impacts or signal-loss effects, but disproportionate adult deaths within a month of trapping. 3. Among 63 dead hawks found by radio-tagging, 35% were killed by humans and 65% died from natural causes, mainly starvation. Ring recoveries over-represented killing by humans. 4. Radio-tagging estimated first-year male survival rates of 0.49-0.54 to the next spring, lower than estimates of 0.69-0.71 for females; combined survival was higher than in contemporary ringing records. Excluding first-month data from trapped adults, second-year survival was 0.59 for males, 0.71 for females, and 0.79-0.83 for both sexes thereafter. 5. No hawks were observed to build nests or lay eggs in their first year. Only 8% of radio-tagged females laid eggs in their second year, but 47% of older females. Second-year males were as often as older males in egg-laying pairs (70%), but were less likely to rear young. 6. Mark-recapture of 351 goshawks ringed in nests estimated that 262 fledged on Gotland annually, from 151 nests with eggs. Emigration was 3% (SE ± 2%), with 1 ringed immigrant. 7.

The model required a 0.5% increase in female survival rate for equal numbers of hawks to pair, and an increase in fledging success from 73% to 75% for a balanced population with a brood size matching the 2.27 of males.

Sensitivity analysis indicates that adult annual survivorship has by far the largest influence on λ, followed by the probability that juveniles survive dispersal, and the adult annual fecundity. Substantial temporal fluctuations in demographic parameters have little effect on the long-run growth rate of the population because of the long adult life expectancy. A model of dispersal and territory occupancy that assumes demographic equilibrium is evaluated using data on the amount of old forest habitat remaining in the Pacific Northwest and the current occupancy of this habitat by northern spotted owls. This model is employed to predict the effect of future habitat loss and fragmentation on the population, implying that extinction will result if the old forest is reduced to less than a proportion 0.21±0.02 of the total area in a large region. The estimated minimum habitat requirement for the population is greater than that allowed in management plants by the USDA Forest Service.",

		"abstract": "[We studied prey populations and the use and composition of home ranges of 47 Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) over 12 mo in five landscapes in two forest types in southwestern Oregon. We measured 1-yr home ranges of 23 owl pairs, 2-yr home ranges of 13 pairs, and 3-yr home ranges of 3 pairs. The landscapes differed in the degree to which old forest had been fragmented by wildfire and logging. Prey populations were measured at 47 sites in southwestern Oregon. Further data on prey populations were gathered on 14 sites on the Olympic Peninsula in northern Washington, where owls use larger ranges than in Oregon. Owls in Washington used @?1700 ha of old forest annually and primarily one prey species; available prey biomass was 61 g/ha. Owls in Oregon Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests used 813 @+ 133 ha (X @+ SE) of old forest annually and concentrated on two prey species that had a combined biomass of 244 g/ha. Owls in Oregon mixed-conifer forest used 454 @+ 84 ha of old forest annually and three primary prey whose availability averaged 338 g/ha. The amount of old forest used by owls studied for 2 yr was 40% greater in the 2nd yr than that used in the 1st yr. No increase in use of old forest was seen in the 3rd yr in Douglas-fir forest; 50% more old forest was used in 3 yr than in the 1st yr in mixed-conifer forest. The most common prey in Washington and Oregon was the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus). In areas where the flying squirrel was the primary prey and where predation was intense (as judged by telemetry), flying squirrel populations were depressed. The addition of medium-sized mammal species, especially woodrats (Neotoma spp.), to the prey base appeared to reduce markedly the amount of old forest used for foraging. Owls traversed 85% more Douglas-fir forest and 3 times more mixed-conifer forest in the heavily fragmented areas than in the lightly fragmented areas. Overlap among pairs and separation of birds within pairs in space increased with fragmentation. In the most heavily fragmented landscape, social structure appeared to be abnormal, as judged by the proportion of adult-subadult pairs, instances of adult nomadism, and overlap among the home ranges of pairs. The pattern of fragmentation affected the ability of owls to find concentrations of old forest in the landscapes. Even so, almost all the owls consistently selected old forests for foraging and roosting; only one owl selected a younger type as part of its foraging range. Selection of old forest was significant at three levels: landscape, annual home ranges of pairs, and foraging and roosting sites of individuals. The most important prey species, the northern flying squirrel, was twice as abundant in old forest as in young forest in all areas. Landscape indices (dominance, contagion, variance in density of old forest) had less predictive ability than indices based on owl home ranges because owls selected areas of concentrated old forest and because patterning was complex, reflecting four processes, each operating at a different scale: physiography, human land ownership (259-ha scale), history of catastrophic fires, and history of small-scale fires and timber harvesting.]",

These\nchanges may also be affecting goshawk populations. Information on\ngoshawk nesting habitat and foraging behavior, and the food and habitats of\nselected goshawk prey, was therefore synthesized to develop a set of\nmanagement objectives, desired forest conditions, and management\nrecommendations. Key objectives of the guidelines are to provide (1)\nnesting, post-fledging, and foraging areas for goshawks, and (2) habitat to\nsupport abundant populations of 14 primary goshawk prey. Thinning trees\nin the understory, creating small openings in the forest, and prescribed fires\nshould help produce and maintain the desired forest conditions. Other\nhabitat elements critical for maintaining both goshawk and prey\npopulations include abundant snags and large downed logs, woody debris,\ninterspersion of different tree sizes across the landscape, and the majority of\na goshawk’s home range in older-aged forests. These guidelines should also\nbenefit forest health, soil productivity, and the habitats of other old-growthdependent\nplants and animals.",

		"abstract": "[To prevent the further loss of species from landscapes used for productive enterprises such as agriculture, forestry, and grazing, it is necessary to determine the composition, quantity, and configuration of landscape elements required to meet the needs of the species present. I present a multi-species approach for defining the attributes required to meet the needs of the biota in a landscape and the management regimes that should be applied. The approach builds on the concept of umbrella species, whose requirements are believed to encapsulate the needs of other species. It identifies a suite of \"focal species,\" each of which is used to define different spatial and compositional attributes that must be present in a landscape and their appropriate management regimes. All species considered at risk are grouped according to the processes that threaten their persistence. These threats may include habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, weed invasion, and fire. Within each group, the species most sensitive to the threat is used to define the minimum acceptable level at which that threat can occur. For example, the area requirements of the species most limited by the availability of particular habitats will define the minimum suitable area of those habitat types; the requirements of the most dispersal-limited species will define the attributes of connecting vegetation; species reliant on critical resources will define essential compositional attributes; and species whose populations are limited by processes such as fire, predation, or weed invasion will define the levels at which these processes must be managed. For each relevant landscape parameter, the species with the most demanding requirements for that parameter is used to define its minimum acceptable value. Because the most demanding species are selected, a landscape designed and managed to meet their needs will encompass the requirements of all other species.]",

		"abstract": "Conservation planners often seek short cuts when making decisions about land use by directing management towards one or a few species that will benefit the wider ecosystem. The umbrella species concept is one such proposed short cut. An umbrella species comprises a population of individuals of a particular species whose resource requirements and habitat needs encompass the sufficient home ranges and resource needs of viable populations of co-occurring species. We examined the 17 published criteria available to identify a potential umbrella species and recommend that conservation managers wishing to apply this concept could focus on only seven criteria: well-known biology; large home range size; high probability of population persistence; co-occurrence of species of conservation interest; management needs that are beneficial to co-occurring species; sensitivity to human disturbance; and ease of monitoring. We note however, that rigorous assessment of candidate umbrella species requires such detailed knowledge of candidate and co-occurring species that it seems less of a short cut than planners may wish.",

		"abstract": "We used a three-year point-count data set from Hoosier National Forest, Indiana, to evaluate alternative point-count sampling strategies for detecting songbird declines. Repeated-measures ANOVA indicated that mean abundance estimates increased with increasing count radius (P < 0.0001, each species), and coefficients of variation (CVs) decreased. Mean abundance estimates increased with longer count duration (6-, 8-, and 10-min) for only two of 13 species, and CVs did not necessarily decrease. The power to detect a 5% annual population trend increased with more survey points, more visits per point, and more years of surveys. Managers can use observer time most efficiently by employing counts of short duration. Counts using a larger radius will reduce CVs and therefore provide potentially better annual estimates of abundance and power to detect changes over a period of years. The design of the study and nature of the variability in bird abundance will determine whether increasing the number of points, or the number of visits per point, will have greater effect on power to detect a population trend. /// Utilizamos datos de conteo de puntos por tres a&#xf1;os, para evaluar estrategias de muestreo de conteo de punto para detectar reducci&#xf3;n de aves canoras.

		"abstract": "Responses of boreal birds to changes in forest structure and composition caused by construction of well pads, seismic lines, and pipelines are poorly understood. Bird species associated with older forests are predicted to experience larger population declines with increased disturbance compared with species associated with younger or open habitats; however, point count methods may influence apparent outcomes because the proportional area of disturbed vegetation and the magnitude, uncertainty, and detection of a disturbance response by birds vary as a function of sampling area. We analyzed point count data from 12 energy sector studies and measured how disturbance type and point count radius interacted to affect 531 impact ratios (mean abundance at point counts centered within disturbances relative to abundance at point counts within forest 150–400 m from the nearest edge bordering those disturbances [59 species*3 disturbance types*3 point count radii]). We observed larger disturbance effects (impact ratios) within larger-radius point counts at well pads (100-m and unlimited-distance) and pipelines (unlimited-distance) compared with 50-m point counts at seismic lines, and within 50-m point counts at well pads relative to 50-m point counts at seismic lines. Effect uncertainty was higher at well pads and pipelines than seismic lines, and lower within larger-radius point counts. The probability of detecting a disturbance response was greater for larger-radius point counts at pipelines than for 50-m point counts at seismic lines, and within 50-m point counts at well pads relative to 50-m point counts at seismic lines. On average, a species was more likely to increase in abundance near an energy sector disturbance if the species was not associated with older (>75 yr) forest stages. While the effects of disturbance varied by species and with disturbance type, the effects of pipelines and seismic lines were better detected by larger-radius point counts, while the effects of well pads were better detected by smaller-radius point counts.",

		"abstract": "Although acoustic recordings have recently gained popularity as an alternative to point counts for surveying birds, little is known about the relative performance of the two methods for detecting tropical bird species across multiple vegetation types. During June and July 2008, we collected species detection/nondetection data to compare the performance of a quadraphonic acoustic recording system and point counts for estimating species richness and composition and detection probabilities of 15 rare, moderately common, and common tropical bird species across six structurally distinct vegetation types (coastal dune scrub, mangrove, low-stature deciduous thorn forest, early and late successional medium-stature semievergreen forest, and grazed pastures) in the northern Yucatan Peninsula. We selected five rare species endemic to the Yucatan Peninsula and 10 moderately common and common species that also occur in other tropical regions. Species richness and composition did not differ between survey methods in any of the vegetation types. At the population level, however, we found support for an effect of method on detection probability for most species. For 13 species, regardless of their abundance, acoustic recordings yielded detection probabilities as high as or higher than those for point counts across all vegetation types. The remaining two species were better detected by point counts in pastures and coastal scrub, where greater visibility likely improved sightings of these species. However, these species were detected as well as or better by acoustic recordings in forests and mangroves where detections were primarily auditory. In tropical regions where experienced field observers may not be available and funding for field surveys may be limited, acoustic recordings offer a practical solution for determining species richness and composition and the occupancy patterns of most species. However, for some species, a combination of methods will provide the most reliable data. Regardless of the method selected, analyses that account for variation in detection probability among vegetation types will be necessary because most species in our study demonstrated vegetation-dependent detection probabilities. El uso de grabaciones acústicas recientemente ha ganado popularidad como una alternativa a los conteos por punto para el muestreo de aves. Sin embargo, poco se sabe sobre el desempeño de ambos métodos en la detección de especies de aves tropicales en múltiples tipos de vegetación. En Junio y Julio del 2008, se colectaron datos de detección/no-detección para comparar el desempeño de un sistema portátil de grabación cuadrafónico y los conteos por punto en la estimación de riqueza de especies, composición y probabilidades de detección de 15 especies tropicales raras, moderadamente comunes y comunes a través de seis diferentes tipos de vegetación tropicales (duna costera, manglar, selva baja caducifolia espinosa, selva mediana subcaducifolia primaria y secundaria y pastizales) en el norte de la Península de Yucatán, México. De las 15 especies seleccionadas para estimar probabilidades de detección, las 5 especies raras son endémicas de la Península de Yucatán y las 10 especies moderadamente comunes y comunes, se distribuyen en otras regiones tropicales. Las estimaciones de la riqueza de especies no fueron significativamente diferentes entre ambos métodos y entre cualquiera de los tipos de vegetación. A nivel poblacional, encontramos efectos de metodología en la probabilidad de detección para la mayoría de las especies. Para 13 especies, independientemente de su estatus de abundancia, el método de grabaciones acústicas resultó en altas o mayores probabilidades de detección que los puntos de conteo en todos los tipos de vegetación. Las otras dos especies fueron mejor detectadas en conteos por puntos en pastizales y en dunas costeras, donde la visibilidad posiblemente mejoró su detección. Sin embargo, estas especies, se detectaron tan bien o mejor por las grabaciones acústicas en selvas y manglares, donde las detecciones fueron primeramente auditivas. En regiones tropicales donde existe limitación de observadores de campo bien capacitados y financiamiento para estudios de campo, las grabaciones acústicas ofrecen una solución practica para describir la riqueza de especies, composición y patrones de ocupación para la mayoría de las especies. Sin embargo, paras algunas especies, la combinación de métodos ofrecerá datos más confiables. Independientemente del método seleccionado, serán necesarios análisis que tomen en cuenta la variación en la probabilidad de detección entre tipos de vegetación ya que la mayoría de las especies demostraron probabilidades de detección dependientes de la vegetación.",

		"abstract": "[Development of the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) was motivated by concerns about the overharvest of late-seral forests and the effects of intensive forest management on the long-term viability of the Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina). Following several years of intense political and legal debates, the final NWFP was approved in 1994. Even though the plan evolved with a broad ecosystem perspective, it remained anchored in the Spotted Owl reserve design proposed in 1990. Based on a criterion of stable or increasing populations, a decade later it remains unclear whether the enactment of the NWFP has improved the conservation status of Spotted Owls. The results of intensive monitoring of several Spotted Owl populations for over a decade suggest a continuing range-wide decline even though rates of timber harvest have declined dramatically on federal lands. The cause of the decline is difficult to determine because the research needed to establish cause and effect relations has not been done. One plausible hypothesis is that the owl's life history greatly constrains its rate of population growth even when habitat is no longer limiting. Since enactment of the NWFP, new threats have arisen, including the movement of Barred Owls (S. varia) into the range of the Spotted Owl, political pressure to increase levels of timber harvest, and recent changes to forest laws that eliminate the requirement to assess the viability of wildlife populations on U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service lands. At this time is appears that Spotted Owl conservation rests critically on continued implementation of the protections afforded by the NWFP and the U.S. Endangered Species Act.]",

		"abstract": "We compared track-tube sampling with mark-recapture livetrapping and evaluated a track-tube index, defined as the number of track tubes with identifiable small mammal tracks during a 4-night period, as a predictor of small mammal abundance estimates in North Dakota grasslands. Meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) were the most commonly recorded species by both methods, but were underrepresented in track-tube sampling, whereas 13-lined ground squirrels (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus) and Franklin's ground squirrels (S. franklinii) were overrepresented in track-tube sampling. Estimates of average species richness were lower from track tubes than from livetrapping. Regression models revealed that the track-tube index was at best a moderately good predictor of small mammal population estimates because both the form (linear versus curvilinear) and slope of the relationship varied between years. In addition, 95% prediction intervals indicated low precision when predicting population estimates from new track-tube index observations. Track tubes required less time and expense than mark-recapture and eliminated handling of small mammals. Using track tubes along with mark-recapture in a double sampling for regression framework would have potential value when attempting to estimate abundance of small mammals over large areas.",

		"abstract": "Sampling of populations of small mammals has traditionally focused on use of live traps, which are often costly and labor intensive. We tested track tubes as an alternative technique for assessing populations of small mammals. Track tubes record footprints of small mammals and allow determination of their presence or absence without live capture. We compared results from livetrapping against data from track tubes on 5 sites over 1-week periods in June 1999 and June 2000. Correlations between indices of abundance from the 2 techniques were significant in 1999 (rs = 0.656, P < 0.001) and 2000 (rs = 0.715, P < 0.001). Using track tubes we distinguished footprints of 4 species. We were not able to distinguish Peromyscus from Clethrionomys gapperi; species of Sorex could not be distinguished. In comparison with livetrapping, track tubes are inexpensive, are much less labor intensive for researchers, and can be run simultaneously on several sites. The technique has good promise where investigators seek only to identify composition and relative abundance of small-mammal species.",

		"abstract": "Detection distance is an important and common auxiliary variable measured during avian point count surveys. Distance data are used to determine the area sampled and to model the detection process using distance sampling theory. In densely forested habitats, visual detections of birds are rare, and most estimates of detection distance are based on auditory cues. Distance sampling theory assumes detection distances are measured accurately, but empirical validation of this assumption for auditory detections is lacking. We used a song playback system to simulate avian point counts with known distances in a forested habitat to determine the error structure of distance estimates based on auditory detections. We conducted field evaluations with 6 experienced observers both before and after distance estimation training. We conducted additional studies to determine the effect of height and speaker orientation (toward or away from observers) on distance estimation error. Distance estimation errors for all evaluations were substantial, although training reduced errors and bias in distance estimates by approximately 15%. Measurement errors showed a nonlinear relationship to distance. Our results suggest observers were not able to differentiate distances beyond 65 m. The height from which we played songs had no effect on distance estimation errors in this habitat. The orientation of the song source did have a large effect on distance estimation errors; observers generally doubled their distance estimates for songs played away from them compared with distance estimates for songs played directly toward them. These findings, which we based on realistic field conditions, suggest measures of uncertainty in distance estimates to auditory detections are substantially higher than assumed by most researchers. This means aural point count estimates of avian abundance based on distance methods deserve careful scrutiny because they are likely biased.",

		"abstract": "[We used data from statewide surveys of riparian birds in Utah, 1992-1998, to compare relative-abundance and distance-sampling methods. By generating relative-abundance indices with point-count methods and density with point-transect sampling methods, we examined whether the assumptions underlying each method were met during field surveys for four bird species (Brown-headed Cowbird [Molothrus ater], Bullock's Oriole [Icterus bullockii], Warbling Vireo [Vireo gilvus], and Yellow Warbler [Dendroica petechia]). Point-count methods failed to reasonably meet the fundamental assumption of constant proportionality, with estimated detectability varying 3- to 5-fold despite the use of widely accepted and well-standardized methods. Population trends based on relative abundance were subsequently unstable, often varying in both magnitude and direction with the survey plot radius used (25 m, 50 m, or unlimited distance). Distance-sampling methods appeared to meet critical assumptions, were robust to assumption violations, allowed methodological self-assessment, and were demonstrably efficient in a large-scale, multispecies survey setting. Our data show surveys of birds without estimations of detectability are likely biased because the assumption of constant proportionality is violated to a degree that precludes strict inference and may confound trend analyses. /// En este estudio utilizamos datos de censos a nivel estatal de aves ribereñas en Utah (1992-1998) para comparar los métodos de abundancia relativa y de muestreo de distancia. Generando índices de abundancia relativa con métodos de conteo de punto y de densidad con muestreos de puntos en transectos, examinamos si los supuestos de cada método se cumplían durante censos de campo realizados para cuatro especies de aves (Molothrus ater, Icterus bullockii, Vireo gilvus y Dendroica petechia). Los métodos de conteo de punto no cumplieron de forma razonable el supuesto fundamental de proporcionalidad constante; la detectabilidad estimada varió de 3 a 5 veces a pesar del uso de métodos ampliamente aceptados y bien estandarizados. Las tendencias poblacionales basadas en abundancia relativa fueron subsecuentemente inestables y a menudo variaron tanto en magnitud como en dirección con el radio de la parcela de muestreo utilizado (25 m, 50 m ó distancia ilimitada). Los métodos de muestreo de distancia parecieron cumplir los supuestos críticos, fueron robustos ante violaciones de los supuestos, permitieron hacer autoevaluaciones metodológicas y fueron eficientes de forma demostrable en un escenario de censo de múltiples especies a gran escala. Nuestros datos muestran que los censos de aves sin estimaciones de la detectabilidad son probablemente sesgados porque el supuesto de proporcionalidad constante es violado a un grado que no permite hacer inferencias estrictas y puede confundir los análisis de tendencias.]",

		"abstract": "Video recording of prey deliveries to nests is a new technique for collecting data on raptor diet, but no thorough comparison of results from traditional methods based on collections of prey remains and pellets has been undertaken. We compared data from these 3 methods to determine relative merits of different methods for assessing raptor diet as part of a study of the breeding-season diet of northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) in Southeast Alaska. We applied these methods to 5 nests during each of the northern goshawk breeding seasons of 1998 and 1999 and identified 1,540 prey from deliveries, 209 prey from remains, and 209 prey from pellets. The proportions of birds and mammals varied among techniques, as did relative proportions of prey groups and age groups. Prey remains and pellets gave the least-similar diet descriptions. Over 2-day intervals during which data were collected using all 3 methods, prey-delivery data gave more individual prey and prey categories than the 2 other sources of information. We found that prey were not directly tracked in either prey remains or pellets compared with prey delivery videography. Analysis of prey-delivery videography provided the most complete description of diet, and we recommend that studies attempting to describe diet use this technique, at least as part of their methodology.",

		"abstract": "We studied the distribution, habitat, home range characteristics, reproductive biology, diet, vocalizations, activity patterns, and social behavior of the spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) in Oregon from 1969 through 1980. Spotted owls were located at 636 sites, including 591 (93%) on federal lands. The range included western Oregon and the east slope of the Cascade Range. Most pairs (97.6%) were found in unlogged old-growth forests or in mixed forests of old-growth and mature timber. No owls were found in forests younger than 36 years old. Paired individuals tended to occupy the same areas year after year and use the same nests more than once. Mean nearest neighbor distances were 2.6 km west of the crest of the Cascade Mountains and 3.3 km on the east slope of the Cascades. From 1969 to 1978, the population declined at an average annual rate of 0.8%. The principal cause of site abandonment was timber harvest. Home range areas ranged from 549 to 3,380 ha. Seasonal home ranges averaged largest during fall and winter. Home range overlap averaged 68% for paired individuals and 12% for individuals occupying adjacent territories. Old-growth forests were consistently preferred for foraging and roosting by all owls studied. In most cases, use of younger forests was either less than or not significantly different than expected. There was no apparent tendency to concentrate foraging activity in \"edge\" areas such as along clear-cut boundaries or roadsides. Owls roosted significantly higher in the forest canopy during cold, wet weather than during warm or hot weather. Of 47 nests located, 30 were in cavities in old-growth conifers and 17 were on platforms of sticks or other debris in mature or old-growth conifers. None of the owls built its own nest. Average nest height was 27.3 m (range = 10.0-55.3 m, SE = 1.67). Forty-two nests were in unmanaged old-growth forests. Canopy closure exceeded 70% in most nest areas. On the average, 62% of the pairs checked each year attempted to nest; 81% of all nesting attempts were successful. Egg laying began between 9 March and 19 April (x̄ = 2 April). Average clutch size was 2. Incubation lasted 30 ± 2 days. Eggs hatched between 8 April and 20 May. Females alone incubated and brooded the young. Males provided all food for the female and young until the young were approximately 2 weeks old. The young left the nest at 34-36 days of age. After leaving the nest, owlets were fed by the adults until late August or September. The young became independent and began dispersal in October. Owlet mortality during the first summer of life was 35%. Before they were killed by predators in midwinter, 2 radio-tagged juveniles traveled maximum straight line distances of 10.1 and 16.4 km from their respective natal sites. The diet varied seasonally and included a variety of mammals, birds, and insects. Mammals comprised 92% of all prey taken. Foraging activity usually began shortly after sunset and ceased shortly before sunrise. Calls given by spotted owls were classified into 13 types. Juveniles did not give adult vocalizations until late September or October of their first year.",

		"abstract": "Recently the US Fish and Wildlife Service, as part of a critical habitat analysis for the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), developed habitat suitability models based on thousands of owl nest sites distributed across 11 regions using the MaxEnt tool. Because these models formed the basis for critical habitat designations on millions of hectares of land, we undertook an independent evaluation of the FWS effort. We evaluated the accuracy of vegetation data used as input to develop the models, conducted out of sample analyses, correlated model output with owl reproductive success in two study areas, and developed alternate models using two different statistical methods. Vegetation data appeared accurate for only a few variables, and accuracy varied among model regions. Out of sample testing gave a high rate of classification errors and owl productivity was not correlated with MaxEnt model output in two study areas. Alternate statistical methods produced reasonable models with fewer variables. Critically, neither the models compared across regions nor the regions analyzed with different tools led to comparable use of variables. Thus biological interpretation of owl habitat selection models seemed ambiguous. In addition, for MaxEnt and one of the other tools, a highly significant trend by regression was found showing decreasing model accuracy as number of training nest sites increased. Together, these two results suggest that the generated models may be spurious to some unknown degree, perhaps because the underlying vegetation data, also derived from a model, are not sufficiently accurate to support the analysis and/or because the owls themselves affect habitat suitability by consuming their prey base. We suggest that the USFWS exercise caution in using MaxEnt models as a basis for regulatory purposes such as consultation, estimating likelihood of occupancy by owls, or evaluation of site-specific recovery actions.",

		"abstract": "[Point counts are the most frequently used technique for sampling bird populations and communities, but have well-known limitations such as inter- and intraobserver errors and limited availability of expert field observers. The use of acoustic recordings to survey birds offers solutions to these limitations. We designed a Soundscape Recording System (SRS) that combines a four-channel, discrete microphone system with a quadraphonic playback system for surveying bird communities. We compared the effectiveness of SRS and point counts for estimating species abundance, richness, and composition of riparian breeding birds in California by comparing data collected simultaneously using both methods. We used the temporal-removal method to estimate individual bird detection probabilities and species abundances using the program MARK. Akaike's Information Criterion provided strong evidence that detection probabilities differed between the two survey methods and among the 10 most common species. The probability of detecting birds was higher when listening to SRS recordings in the laboratory than during the field survey. Additionally, SRS data demonstrated a better fit to the temporal-removal model assumptions and yielded more reliable estimates of detection probability and abundance than point-count data. Our results demonstrate how the perceptual constraints of observers can affect temporal detection patterns during point counts and thus influence abundance estimates derived from time-of-detection approaches. We used a closed-population capture–recapture approach to calculate jackknife estimates of species richness and average species detection probabilities for SRS and point counts using the program CAPTURE. SRS and point counts had similar species richness and detection probabilities. However, the methods differed in the composition of species detected based on Jaccard's similarity index. Most individuals (83%) detected during point counts vocalized at least once during the survey period and were available for detection using a purely acoustic technique, such as SRS. SRS provides an effective method for surveying bird communities, particularly when most species are detected by sound. SRS can eliminate or minimize observer biases, produce permanent records of surveys, and resolve problems associated with the limited availability of expert field observers. /// Los conteos por punto son la técnica más utilizada para muestrear poblaciones y comunidades de aves, pero tienen limitaciones tales como los errores intra- e inter-observador y la escasa disponibilidad de observadores expertos. Una solución a estas limitaciones es el uso de grabaciones en el campo para censar aves. Diseñamos un sistema de grabación de paisajes sonoros, SRS (por sus siglas en inglés), que combina un sistema de grabación de cuatro canales discretos con un sistema de reproducción cuadrafónica para el censado de comunidades de aves. Comparamos la efectividad del SRS y la de los conteos por punto para estimar la abundancia, riqueza y composición de comunidades de aves en hábitats riparios en California, comparando los datos colectados simultáneamente con ambas técnicas. Utilizamos el método de remoción-temporal para estimar la probabilidad de detección de individuos y abundancia de especies utilizando el programa MARK. El Criterio de Información Akaike proveyó evidencia sustancial de que existen diferencias en la probabilidad de detección entre ambos métodos y entre las 10 especies más comunes de aves. La probabilidad de detección de aves resultó mayor cuando se escucharon las grabaciones del SRS en el laboratorio que durante los conteos por punto en el campo. Además, los datos tomados con la técnica SRS demostraron estar mejor adaptados a los supuestos del modelo de remoción-temporal y ofrecieron estimados más confiables de abundancia y de probabilidad de detección que los datos de conteos por puntos. Nuestros resultados demuestran cómo la percepción de los observadores puede afectar los patrones de detección temporal durante los conteos por punto, influyendo en las estimaciones de abundancia derivadas de procedimientos de tiempo de detección. Utilizamos el método de captura-recaptura de población cerrada para calcular las estimaciones de jackknife de riqueza de especies y la probabilidad de detección de especies para SRS y conteos por punto, utilizando el programa CAPTURE. Ambos tuvieron índices de riqueza de especies y probabilidades de detección similares. Sin embargo, los métodos difirieron en la composición de especies detectadas basados en el índice de similitud de Jaccard. La mayoría de los individuos detectados durante los conteos por punto (83%) vocalizaron al menos una vez durante el periodo de censado, y estuvieron disponibles para ser detectados utilizando una técnica acústica, como SRS. La técnica SRS provee un método efectivo para censar comunidades de aves, particularmente cuando la mayoría de las especies son detectadas por sus sonidos. El SRS puede eliminar o minimizar los sesgos del observador, producir registros permanentes de los censos, y resolver problemas asociados a la limitada disponibilidad de expertos en el campo.]",

		"abstract": "Point counts are one of the most commonly used methods for assessing bird abundance. Autonomous recording units (ARUs) are increasingly being used as a replacement for human-based point counts. Previous studies have compared the relative benefits of human versus ARU-based point count methods, primarily with the goal of understanding differences in species richness and the abundance of individuals over an unlimited distance. What has not been done is an evaluation of how to standardize these two types of data so that they can be compared in the same analysis, especially when there are differences in the area sampled. We compared detection distances between human observers in the field and four commercially available recording devices (Wildlife Acoustics SM2, SM3, RiverForks, and Zoom H1) by simulating vocalizations of various avian species at different distances and amplitudes. We also investigated the relationship between sound amplitude and detection to simplify ARU calibration. We used these data to calculate correction factors that can be used to standardize detection distances of ARUs relative to each other and human observers. In general, humans in the field could detect sounds at greater distances than an ARU although detectability varied depending on species song characteristics. We provide correction factors for four commonly used ARUs and propose methods for calibrating ARUs relative to each other and human observers.",

		"abstract": "Acoustic recordings are increasingly used to quantify occupancy and abundance in avian monitoring and research. The recent development of relatively inexpensive programmable autonomous recording units (ARUs) has further increased the utility of acoustic recording technologies. Despite their potential advantages, persistent questions remain as to how comparable data are between ARUs and traditional (human observer) point counts. We suggest that differences in counts obtained from ARUs versus human observers primarily stem from differences in the effective detection radius of humans (EDRH) versus ARUs (EDRA). We describe how paired sampling can be used in conjunction with generalized linear (GLM) or generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to estimate correction factors (δ) to remove biases between ARUs and traditional point counts. Furthermore, if human observers conduct distance estimation, we show that density estimates can be derived from single ARUs by estimating EDRA as a function of EDRH and δ, thus providing alternatives to more complicated and expensive approaches. We demonstrate our approach using data from 363 point count stations in 105 unique boreal study sites at which field staff conducted point count surveys that were simultaneously recorded by an ARU and later transcribed in the lab. Finally, we used repeated random subsampling of the data to split the data into model creation (70%) and validation (30%) subsets to iteratively estimate δ and validate density estimates from ARUs against densities calculated from human observers at the same independent validation locations. We modeled density of 35 species of boreal forest birds and show that incorporating δ in statistical offsets successfully removes systematic biases in estimated avian counts and/or density between human and ARU derived surveys. Our method is therefore easily implemented and will facilitate the integration of ARU and human observer point count data, facilitating expanded monitoring efforts and meta-analyses with historic point count data.",

		"abstract": "Live trapping is one of the methods typically used to estimate population densities of small mammals, but this is labor-intensive and can be stressful to individuals. We assess the use of camera trap hit (detection) rates as a noninvasive alternative to live trapping for estimating population densities of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus (Erxleben, 1777)) and red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus (Erxleben, 1777))—two common small (≤1.5 kg) mammal species in the boreal forests of northern North America. We compared hit rates from camera trapping to live trapping mark-recapture density estimates and asked if the hit window—the length of time used to group consecutive videos together as single detections or “hits”—has an effect on the correlation between hit rates and live trapping density estimates. The relationship between hit rate and population density was sensitive to hit window duration for red squirrels with R2 values ranging from 0.41 to 0.68, and a 5-min hit window generated the highest value. R2 values for snowshoe hares ranged from 0.70 to 0.90, and a 10-min hit window generated the highest value, but hares were live trapped and filmed only at very low densities. Our results indicate that camera trapping is a robust means for estimating the density of red squirrels, but the appropriate hit window duration must be determined empirically if camera trapping data are to be used to monitor populations of this species. Additional live trapping and filming of snowshoe hares is required to better assess camera trapping of this species.",

		"abstract": "We developed rainproof track stations to index sciurid abundance. Track stations were effective at detecting presence of a species and provided a useful index of abundance in two validation efforts. In the more rigorous validation, we documented the correlation of two indices of abundance (our track index and catch-per-unit-effort, CPUE) with population size of Abert's squirrels (Sciurus aberti) as estimated by mark-recapture methods on eight 60-ha plots in April and August 1996. The track index (number of stations visited) was correlated highly with estimated population size in both April (r = 0.983) and August (r = 0.924). CPUE, as measured by the cumulative number of squirrels captured in the first day and first 2 days of the trapping effort, performed as well (r = 0.905 in April and r = 0.945 in August) as the track index. We also examined the correlation between these two indices for chipmunks (Tamias), golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis), rock squirrels (S. variegatus), and Abert's squirrels by double-sampling 30 plots (2.25 ha each) for diurnal sciurids in 1994 and 1995. The track index and CPUE were correlated highly for chipmunks (r = 0.815), golden-mantled ground squirrels (r = 0.881), rock squirrels (r = 0.868), and Abert's squirrels (r = 0.926). Similarity of regression slopes suggested that the track index was valid across seasons. Both the trap index and CPUE were less powerful statistically than mark-recapture estimates in detecting differences among plots and between seasons but did detect large differences without unacceptable Type I errors. Compared to live-trapping, track stations provided results in less time, were less expensive and easier to deploy in the field, caused no mortality to animals, and eliminated exposure of technicians to diseases transmitted by rodents.",

		"abstract": "Monitoring of forest songbirds via auditory detections during point surveys can be enhanced by using preprogrammed recording devices. During May–July 2008, we compared boreal forest bird surveys conducted with SM-1 bird song recorders (Wildlife Acoustics, Inc.) with field surveys by observers and surveys recorded with the E3A Bio-Acoustic Monitor Kit (River Forks Research Corp.) in Ontario, Canada, to evaluate the utility of the SM-1 to generate reliable detections of forest birds. The SM-1 surveys identified, on average, 8.95 species, 0.76 fewer species per 10-min point count than field surveys ($ ar x$ = 9.71 species) and 1.26 fewer species than the E3A ($ ar x$ = 10.21 species). SM-1 surveys also identified on average 11.6 individuals per 10-min count, 2.5 fewer than field surveys ($ ar x$ = 14.1) and 2.3 fewer than E3A surveys ($ ar x$ = 13.9), respectively. The lower number of SM-1 detections, however, was less than the reduction in detections made by field surveys later as compared to earlier in the breeding season. This suggests that SM-1 recorders set up early in the season would detect more birds than field surveys stretching late into the season. Moreover, lower detections with the SM-1 could be easily offset by collecting an additional 10-min sample on another day. Most species were detected equally well by all 3 methods with a few exceptions. Unattended recording devices are especially advantageous in situations where the number of experienced observers is limited, where access difficult, where multiple samples at the same site are desirable, and where it is desirable to eliminate inter-observer, time-of-day and time-of-season effects. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.",

		"abstract": "During the 1990s, we conducted research on the distribution, productivity, and habitat relationships of Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) in eastern Oregon and Washington. Our research was initiated primarily in response to concerns raised about the status of Northern Goshawks in the western US, and coincided with early attempts to list the species as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act and the publication of management guidelines for goshawks in the southwestern US. To develop baseline information on the status, distribution, and habitat relationships of goshawks in eastside forests (i.e., east of the Cascade Mountain Range) in the Pacific Northwest, we established study areas on three national forests in eastern Oregon in 1992, adding a fourth study area in central Washington in 1994. We focused on the breeding season and nesting habitat because of its primary importance to goshawk ecology and the logistical feasibility of finding nests. Density of breeding pairs ranged from 0.03-0.09/100 ha, and annual productivity ranged from 0.3-2.2 young fledged/nest. Goshawks selected forest stands with trees of larger diameter and greater canopy closure for nesting than available in the landscape. Occasionally nests could be found in large trees in open-canopied stands. As distance increased from the nest site, forest type and structure became more heterogeneous and the prevalence of older-seral-stage forest declined. Dry or wet openings were present in most territories, often within close proximity to nest stands. Goshawks ate a variety of mammalian and avian prey. Mammal species made up a larger portion of prey biomass on two of the national forests, but avian species appeared to be more prevalent in the diet of goshawks in the most northern study area. We recommend that the existing management guidelines for goshawks in the Southwest form a basis for management in the inland Pacific Northwest, particularly with regard to nested spatial concepts, emphasis on management of prey, and the use of silviculture to promote the development and replacement of old growth or late-seral-stage forest. Our research and management recommendations can be used in concert with the Southwestern management guidelines to establish a mix of vegetation structural stages to support goshawk populations, their prey, and other forest wildlife species specifically for the inland Pacific Northwest.",

		"abstract": "Northern Goshawks occupying the Alexander Archipelago, Alaska, and coastal British Columbia nest primarily in old-growth and mature forest, which results in spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of individuals across the landscape. We used microsatellite and mitochondrial data to infer genetic structure, gene flow, and fluctuations in population demography through evolutionary time. Patterns in the genetic signatures were used to assess predictions associated with the three population models: panmixia, metapopulation, and isolated populations. Population genetic structure was observed along with asymmetry in gene flow estimates that changed directionality at different temporal scales, consistent with metapopulation model predictions. Therefore, Northern Goshawk assemblages located in the Alexander Archipelago and coastal British Columbia interact through a metapopulation framework, though they may not fit the classic model of a metapopulation. Long-term population sources (coastal mainland British Columbia) and sinks (Revillagigedo and Vancouver islands) were identified. However, there was no trend through evolutionary time in the directionality of dispersal among the remaining assemblages, suggestive of a rescue–effect dynamic. Admiralty, Douglas, and Chichagof island complex appears to be an evolutionarily recent source population in the Alexander Archipelago. In addition, Kupreanof island complex and Kispiox Forest District populations have high dispersal rates to populations in close geographic proximity and potentially serve as local source populations. Metapopulation dynamics occurring in the Alexander Archipelago and coastal British Columbia by Northern Goshawks highlight the importance of both occupied and unoccupied habitats to long-term population persistence of goshawks in this region.",

		"abstract": "Predators impose strong selection on their prey, regulate prey populations and engage in coevolutionary interactions with their prey. The intensity of selection and the strength of coevolutionary interactions will depend on how stringent predators are in their choice of prey. We estimated susceptibility of different species of birds to predation by two common raptors, the northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis and the Eurasian sparrowhawk A. nisus, in an agricultural landscape in Denmark and boreal forests in Finland. We estimated susceptibility to predation as the deviation of the log10-transformed observed frequency of prey of different species from the log10-transformed expectation based on population density during the breeding season. We found a high degree of consistency in susceptibility to predation by the goshawk in two areas in Finland. More importantly, there was significant consistency in susceptibility to predation between Denmark and Finland, albeit the degree of consistency in the goshawk was higher than in the sparrowhawk. There was considerable overlap in susceptibility to predation between goshawk and sparrowhawk in Denmark, but not in Finland, implying differences in intensity of interspecific competition as reflected by a much higher extent of goshawk predation on sparrowhawks in Denmark than in Finland. Our findings suggest that hawks impose similar selection pressures on their prey populations, and that the degree of consistency has implications for intensity of interspecific killing.",

		"abstract": "Capsule: Northern Goshawk Accipiter gentilis diet has changed significantly since the 1980s, probably due to changes in populations of preferred prey species.Aims and methods: To assess changes to the breeding season diet of the Northern Goshawk in southwest Europe over three decades. We examined prey remains at and around nests and assessed avian prey availability using point count and line transect surveys.Results: During 2008–11, Goshawks mainly ate birds, with Feral Pigeons Columba livia f. domestica being the most important prey species. Goshawks preferred prey of 100−400 g and forest prey species to non-forest species. Goshawk diet has changed significantly over recent decades: 22% of current prey items belong to species that were not part of the diet in the 1980s. We suggest that these dietary changes reflect changes in the abundance of prey species of the preferred size caused by changes in land use leading to an increase in forest cover, new prey species colonization and changes in the abundance and management of domestic prey.Conclusion: This study emphasizes that major transformations occurring in agroforestry systems are affecting the main preferred prey of important forest predators, which may have consequences for conservation of both the predators and their prey.",

		"abstract": "Understanding the resource needs of animals is critical to their management and conservation. Resource utilization functions (RUFs) provide a framework to investigate animal-resource relationships by characterizing variation in the amount of resource use. In this context a ‘resource’ is any aspect of a species' fundamental niche that can be mapped throughout the area of investigation (such as study area or home range). Extensive global positioning system (GPS) data from 17 cougars (Puma concolor) demonstrate the utility and potential challenges of estimating RUFs within the home range for far-ranging species. Ninety-nine per cent utilization distributions (UDs) estimated using bivariate plug in, univariate least-squares cross-validation and reference bandwidth selection methods were compared. Distance to water, per cent clear-cut and regenerating forest, and slope were used to estimate cougar RUFs. UDs derived from GPS data were more refined, and plug-in UDs were least similar to UDs derived from other bandwidths. RUFs were resilient to variation in the smoothing parameter, with all methods yielding coefficients that largely reflected observations of foraging ecology and behaviour. Cougars were individualistic, but use was generally positively associated with the presence of regenerating forest and inversely associated with steep slopes. Advances in technology allow for greater accuracy and resolution of the UD, but software improvements and spatially explicit information on animal behaviour are needed to better understand resource use.",

		"abstract": "Modern ecological research often involves the comparison of the usage of habitat types or food items to the availability of those resources to the animal. Widely used methods of determining preference from measurements of usage and availability depend critically on the array of components that the researcher, often with a degree of arbitrariness, deems available to the animal. This paper proposes a new method, based on ranks of components by usage and by availability. A virtue of the rank procedure is that it provides comparable results whether a questionable component is included or excluded from consideration. Statistical tests of significance are given for the method. The paper also offers a hierarchical ordering of selection processes. This hierarchy resolves certain inconsistencies among studies of selection and is compatible with the analytic technique offered in this paper.",

		"abstract": "Abstract We used radiotelemetry to study space use and habitat selection of 16 Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) on the eastern slope of the Cascade Mountains, Washington, U.S.A., in 19891990. We used a geographical information system (GIS) and aerial photo interpretation of digital orthophotos to assign owl locations a value for vegetation type, topographic position, amount of edge, and distance to water. We compared owl relocations and random locations within 95 fixed kernel (FK) home ranges to determine each owl's selection of cover types, using logistic regression and generalized estimating equations (GEE) to estimate an exponential resource selection function likelihood. Minimum convex polygon (MCP) home ranges (SE) averaged 2858 ha (712 ha) for males and 1883 ha (249 ha) for females. Individual 95 FK home ranges averaged 1980 ha (229 ha) for males and 1649 ha (163 ha) for females. Pair home ranges averaged 3419 ha (826 ha) for MCP and 2427 ha (243 ha) for 95 FK. Nonbreeding season home ranges averaged approximately 3.5 times larger than breeding season home ranges for both males and females. Our best habitat model indicated that owls selected closed-canopy forests with a component of large (50 cm dbh) trees for roosting and foraging. In a given cover type, owls foraged lower on the slope. Management circles centered on nest areascommonly used as a surrogate for home rangescan be relatively poor representations of actual ranges used by pairs. However, an alternative for managing Spotted Owl home ranges is not readily available. Maintaining sufficient closed-canopy forest to provide habitat for Spotted Owls in the dry, fire-prone forests on the eastern slope of the Washington Cascades will be a challenge because forestry methods used to reduce the risk or severity of fire generally reduce the prevalence of structural features that characterize good Spotted Owl habitat.",

		"abstract": "We revisit the common standards recommended by Ralph et al. (1993, 1995a) for conducting point-count surveys to assess the relative abundance of landbirds breeding in North America. The standards originated from discussions among ornithologists in 1991 and were developed so that point-count survey data could be broadly compared and jointly analyzed by national data centers with the goals of monitoring populations and managing habitat. Twenty years later, we revisit these standards because (1) they have not been universally followed and (2) new methods allow estimation of absolute abundance from point counts, but these methods generally require data beyond the original standards to account for imperfect detection. Lack of standardization and the complications it introduces for analysis become apparent from aggregated data. For example, only 3% of 196,000 point counts conducted during the period 1992–2011 across Alaska and Canada followed the standards recommended for the count period and count radius. Ten-minute, unlimited-count-radius surveys increased the number of birds detected by >300% over 3-minute, 50-m-radius surveys. This effect size, which could be eliminated by standardized sampling, was ≥10 times the published effect sizes of observers, time of day, and date of the surveys. We suggest that the recommendations by Ralph et al. (1995a) continue to form the common standards when conducting point counts. This protocol is inexpensive and easy to follow but still allows the surveys to be adjusted for detection probabilities. Investigators might optionally collect additional information so that they can analyze their data with more flexible forms of removal and time-of-detection models, distance sampling, multiple-observer methods, repeated counts, or combinations of these methods. Maintaining the common standards as a base protocol, even as these study-specific modifications are added, will maximize the value of point-count data, allowing compilation and analysis by regional and national data centers.",

		"abstract": "Diet studies present numerous methodological challenges. We evaluated the usefulness of\ncommercially available trail-cameras for analyzing the diet of Northern Goshawks (Accipiter\ngentilis) as a model for nesting raptors during the period 2007–2011. We compared diet estimates\nobtained by direct camera monitoring of 80 nests with four indirect analyses of prey\nremains collected from the nests and surroundings (pellets, bones, feather-and-hair remains,\nand feather-hair-and-bone remains combined). In addition, we evaluated the performance\nof the trail-cameras and whether camera monitoring affected Goshawk behavior.\nThe sensitivity of each diet-analysis method depended on prey size and taxonomic group,\nwith no method providing unbiased estimates for all prey sizes and types. The cameras registered\nthe greatest number of prey items and were probably the least biased method for estimating\ndiet composition. Nevertheless this direct method yielded the largest proportion of\nprey unidentified to species level, and it underestimated small prey. Our trail-camera system\nwas able to operate without maintenance for longer periods than what has been reported in\nprevious studies with other types of cameras. Initially Goshawks showed distrust toward the\ncameras but they usually became habituated to its presence within 1–2 days. The habituation\nperiod was shorter for breeding pairs that had previous experience with cameras. Using\ntrail-cameras to monitor prey provisioning to nests is an effective tool for studying the diet of\nnesting raptors. However, the technique is limited by technical failures and difficulties in\nidentifying certain prey types. Our study also shows that cameras can alter adult Goshawk\nbehavior, an aspect that must be controlled to minimize potential negative impacts.",

We randomly assigned 28 nests as treatments or controls. Every two days (from hatching [late April] until juvenile dispersal [mid-October]) we visited control nest stands and provided food at treatment nest stands. We measured morphological characteristics and attached tarsal-mounted transmitters with mortality switches to 42 nestling Northern Goshawks when they were 21 days old. In both 1992 and 1993, we relocated birds via telemetry every other day until mid-August. We located birds at least once a week from mid-August until mid-October in 1992, and until late-November 1993. There were no significant differences in nestling size. Treatment birds had a significantly higher survival rate during the nestling period in 1993, but not in 1992. Because most control nestlings died from predation, we attribute higher nestling survival to increased time spent in nest stands by adult females, whose presence probably deterred predators.]",

		"abstract": "Our current understanding of the relationship between imperiled species and forest management can benefit from global positioning system (GPS) technologies. Fauna of lateseral stage forests have historically been difficult to detect and track in rugged terrain, leading to challenges in movement characterization and conservation. We investigated movement of California Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) using automated GPS loggers affixed to 15 owls in the northern Sierra Nevada, California. We used >17,000 locations from individual owls to characterize homerange size, movement distances, and roosting and foraging habitat selection at four spatio-temporal scales (landscape, home range, foray, nightly) during the breeding season (April–August). Additionally, we assessed owl use of Protected Activity Centers (PACs), which are designated by the U.S.D.A. Forest Service to protect nesting and roosting habitat. Our results corroborated some previous findings about habitat requirements of California Spotted Owls, while also revealing new nuances in space use and habitat selection. Roosting and foraging owls selected stands with high canopy cover and large trees at multiple spatio-temporal scales, with foraging owls showing strongest selection at the largest (landscape) scale investigated. Although owls selected for PACs while foraging and roosting, PACs protected less than one quarter of foraging space use (volume of use) and fewer than half of observed roosts during the breeding season. Female owl home ranges were double the size of male home ranges, and distances travelled from the nest by females were 1.3 times greater than distances travelled by males, with non-breeding females travelling farthest and visiting up to six PACs during a single breeding season. Foraying behavior of this sort has not been documented previously in California Spotted Owls. Our findings support protection of later seral stage forest attributes for roosting and foraging California Spotted Owls. Given their selection for later seral forest attributes, strongest evidence of foraging habitat selection at the landscape scale, long distances travelled by owls and limited habitat protection afforded by PACs, habitat connectivity across the landscape is likely an important component for owl conservation, and distribution of current protected areas may be inadequate for this wide-ranging species.",

		"abstract": "We tested three predictions of a hypothesis that states Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) select habitat according to the distribution of their primary prey. Our predictions were that Northern Spotted Owls should (1) select larger (> 100 g) species among the assemblage of available prey, (2) select habitats according to the distribution of large prey, and (3) the owl's reproductive success should be influenced by the availability of large prey. We also evaluated the potential energetic value of several prey species. We found that Northern Spotted Owls (n = 11 pairs and 1 single male) in northwestern California differentially selected the dusky-footed woodrat (Neotoma fuscipes), a moderately large sigmodontine rodent (x̄ mass = 232 g). When foraging, owls selected late seral forest edge sites where dusky-footed woodrats were more abundant. Although the relationship between site selection, prey abundance, and the owl's breeding success was not statistically significant, the average abundance of dusky-footed woodrats at sites foraged by breeding owls (x̄ = 11.4 woodrats 100-trap-nights-1) was greater than at sites foraged by nonbreeding owls (x̄ = 4.7 woodrats 100-trap-nights-1). We estimated that a male Spotted Owl would require 150,015 to 336,232 kJ over a 153-day period while helping to produce one young, and concluded that the selection of woodrats provided a potential energetic benefit over the use of other prey. These findings provide a partial explanation for the owl's affinity for late seral forests.",

		"abstract": "Biodiversity conservation in mixed-ownership landscapes often depends on contributions from privately-owned lands, where natural resource development can alter and produce novel habitat conditions for species of conservation concern. A lack of research on private lands stemming from access issues and concerns over regulatory outcomes, however, often limits evaluation of the impact of land management. The California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis), for example, often occurs in mixed-ownership landscapes but research on this species has occurred primarily on public lands. Therefore, we conducted the first large-scale private-public cooperative and comparative analyses of California spotted owls inhabiting mixed-ownership landscapes in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. We surveyed 151 spotted owl sites from 2013 to 2017 within two study systems: one comprised primarily of public lands (national forests) where the owl population has declined over the last ∼20 years and a set of study areas comprised mostly of private lands on which relatively high estimates of site occupancy were recently reported. Multistate occupancy modeling indicated that the probability of occupancy and successful reproduction by owls depended on site status in the previous year, with both probabilities highest at sites where owls successfully reproduced in the previous year, intermediate at occupied sites where owls had not successfully reproduced, and lowest at previously unoccupied sites. Site occupancy probability was higher at low-elevation sites and lower at sites that contained more open area and younger forest. Successful reproduction by owls was also more likely at low-elevation sites and at sites with more north-facing slope and younger forest with high basal area of hardwoods. Study areas with more private lands tended to occur at lower elevations and have greater amounts of younger forest with high basal area of hardwoods, which may have contributed to higher occupancy and reproductive probabilities than the study area with more public land. Thus, differences in occupancy and reproductive probabilities between study areas appeared to be the result of differences in topographic and vegetation conditions that likely promote populations of key spotted owl prey species. Our results suggest that private lands in mixed-ownership landscapes may contribute to spotted owl conservation by conferring different benefits to owls than public lands and, more broadly, highlight the importance of including private lands in conservation research and planning.",

		"abstract": "Citizen science data are increasingly making valuable contributions to ecological studies. However, many citizen science surveys are also designed to encourage wide participation and therefore the participants have a range of natural history expertise, leading to variation and potentially bias in the data. We assessed a recently proposed measure of observer expertise, calculated based on the average numbers of species recorded by observers. We investigated if this observer expertise score is associated with how often an observer reports any individual species. Species reporting rates increased monotonically with the observer's expertise score for 197 of 200 species, suggesting that this expertise score describes inter-observer variation in the detectability of individual species. Expertise scores were incorporated into single-species occupancy models as a covariate, to explain inter-observer variation in detectability. Including expertise as a detectability covariate led to improved model fit and improved predictive performance on validation data. The expertise score had a large effect on the estimated detectability, comparable in magnitude to the effect of the duration of the observation period. Expertise scores were also included into single-species occupancy models that estimated seasonal patterns in species occupancy and seasonal expertise effects. The addition of a seasonal effect of expertise led to improved model fit and increased predictive performance on validation data. The seasonal expertise accounted for bias that may be introduced by seasonal differences in the effect of expertise, caused by changes in the environment or species behaviour. Measures of observer expertise included in models as a covariate can account for heterogeneity and bias introduced by variable expertise, although in this example the differences in estimated occupancy were small. This method of incorporating observer expertise can be used in any regression model of species occurrence, occupancy, abundance, or density to produce more reliable ecological inference and may be most important where citizen science schemes encourage wide participation. Overall, the results highlight the value of recording observer identity and other detectability covariates, to control for sources of bias associated with the observation process.",

		"abstract": "Increasing frequency and severity of wildfire may jeopardize persistence of large tracts of late seral forest, raising concerns over population viability of forest-dependent species like the Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis). We tracked 20 adult Northern Goshawks with GPS loggers over 4 years to investigate roosting (nocturnal) and foraging (diurnal) habitat selection in a heterogeneously burned forest landscape of the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, United States. Goshawks selected late seral forest attributes for both roosting and foraging at multiple spatio-temporal scales, although at the finest (daily) scale, goshawks selected more diverse forest structure that included small trees and medium canopy cover. Less than 6% of roosts were in areas burned in the last 50 years and goshawks avoided areas burned at high severity when roosting and when foraging across spatial scales. Four goshawks (3 males, 1 female) undertook forays >5 km from their nest location, two of which forayed into burned areas during at least one season. High severity fire is likely to make forests unsuitable foraging or roosting habitat for Northern Goshawks, although lower severity fire may provide foraging opportunities for this generalist predator. Eighty percent of foraging space use and 87% of roost locations were considered high fire hazard potential, suggesting that goshawk habitat in western North America is likely to be reduced by predicted increases in fire frequency and severity in the region.",

		"abstract": "1. There is a rapidly growing literature on how climate affects populations of vertebrates. For large herbivorous mammals, most attention has been paid to demographic responses to climate variation. Much less information is available regarding how climate affects animal behaviour, i.e. the climate mechanisms. Further, the appropriate measurement scale of climate variables remains debated. Here, we investigate how local climate variables determine home range sizes at four temporal scales using the Börger-method on GPS telemetry data from 47 female red deer Cervus elaphus L. in Norway. 2. If local climate operates directly on the immediate activity level of the animal, we predict home range sizes to show season-specific variation on short temporal scale (weekly-daily) related to temperature and precipitation. If local climate operate indirectly through plant growth, we rather predict variation in home range sizes to be apparent on longer time scales (biweekly-monthly), and during summer only. 3. At all time scales home range size was positively correlated with temperature during winter and negatively during summer, while the effect of precipitation was season- and scale-specific, except when accumulating as snow. Extensive snow cover decreased home range size, indicating direct effects of climate. 4. The effects of local climate was weaker at the shortest time scales (weekly-daily) compared to the longest time scales (monthly-biweekly), while the effects of day length on home range size was only apparent on the monthly and daily scale. At the longest time scales variation in local climate had a large effect on home range size. This is consistent with climatic variables operating indirectly through plant growth, but we cannot exclude a certain direct effect even at longer time scales. 5. We show how local climate-home range size correlations measured over different temporal scales can be used to infer direct and indirect climate mechanisms. Insight on the behavioural basis of responses to climate enables more accurate predictions of possible nonlinear relationships to future global warming.",

		"abstract": "Recent extensions of occupancy modeling have focused not only on the distribution of species over space, but also on additional state variables (e.g., reproducing or not, with or without disease organisms, relative abundance categories) that provide extra information about occupied sites. These biologist-driven extensions are characterized by ambiguity in both species presence and correct state classification, caused by imperfect detection. We first show the relationships between independently published approaches to the modeling of multistate occupancy. We then extend the pattern-based modeling to the case of sampling over multiple seasons or years in order to estimate state transition probabilities associated with system dynamics. The methodology and its potential for addressing relevant ecological questions are demonstrated using both maximum likelihood (occupancy and successful reproduction dynamics of California Spotted Owl) and Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation approaches (changes in relative abundance of green frogs in Maryland). Just as multistate capture—recapture modeling has revolutionized the study of individual marked animals, we believe that multistate occupancy modeling will dramatically increase our ability to address interesting questions about ecological processes underlying population-level dynamics.",

		"abstract": "Accurate knowledge of geographic ranges and genetic relationships among populations is important when managing a species or population of conservation concern. Along the western coast of Canada, a subspecies of the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis laingi) is legally designated as Threatened. The range and distinctness of this form, in comparison with the broadly distributed North American subspecies (Accipiter gentilis atricapillus), is unclear. Given this morphological uncertainty, we analyzed genomic relationships in thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms identified using genotyping-by-sequencing of high-quality genetic samples. Results revealed a genetically distinct population of northern goshawks on the archipelago of Haida Gwaii and subtle structuring among other North American sampling regions. We then developed genotyping assays for ten loci that are highly differentiated between the two main genetic clusters, allowing inclusion of hundreds of low-quality samples and confirming that the distinct genetic cluster is restricted to Haida Gwaii. As the laingi form was originally described as being based on Haida Gwaii (where the type specimen is from), further morphological analysis may result in this name being restricted to the Haida Gwaii genetic cluster. Regardless of taxonomic treatment, the distinct Haida Gwaii genetic cluster along with the small and declining population size of the Haida Gwaii population suggests a high risk of extinction of an ecologically and genetically distinct form of northern goshawk. Outside of Haida Gwaii, sampling regions along the coast of BC and southeast Alaska (often considered regions inhabited by laingi) show some subtle differentiation from other North American regions. These results will increase the effectiveness of conservation management of northern goshawks in northwestern North America. More broadly, other conservation-related studies of genetic variation may benefit from the two-step approach we employed that first surveys genomic variation using high-quality samples and then genotypes low-quality samples at particularly informative loci.",

		"abstract": "The brood size in the Finnish Northern Goshawks seems to be associated with the breeding habitat and the availability of suitable prey. In this study, we examined these relationships in three study areas of different landscape structure in southern Finland, including a recently colonized urban area. The most abundant prey categories found in the food remains of the goshawk included corvids, turdids, columbids, gallinaceous birds, and squirrels. Corvids dominated in the diet samples of all the study areas. The number of turdids and columbids in the samples was significantly higher in both the rural and the urban habitats than in the wilderness area. The number of gallinaceous birds was significantly higher in the wilderness area than in other habitats. Gallinaceous birds, particularly tetraonids, the traditional staple food of the Northern Goshawk in Finland, seemed to be largely compensated by corvids in the wilderness area and by corvids and columbids in the rural and urban areas. The amount of corvids in prey showed a positive relationship with brood size, suggesting some particular importance of this prey in the goshawk diet. In all, diet seemed to explain partly between-landscape variations in the brood size of the goshawk. The brood size was significantly higher in the urban landscape than elsewhere.",

		"abstract": "In the current scenario of human-induced environmental changes, boreal forest biodiversity appears to be threatened by both deforestation for timber production and climate change. A northern species which has experienced a decline due to ongoing habitat degradation in Finland is the Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), a forest-dwelling avian predator that inhabits mostly mature coniferous forests. In order to uncover possible interactive effects of climate and landscape structure on this species, we tested whether temperature and precipitation affect Goshawk reproductive performance differentially in closed (i.e. forest) or open (mainly forest–farmland mosaics) habitats, accounting for land cover at different distances from nests (250, 500, 1000 and 2500 m). Long-term data on brood size and individual chick weight were used to describe breeding success over an 18 year period. Brood size was negatively associated with March and May temperature and positively with June temperature, but no trends related to landscape structure were identified. Chick body condition was negatively affected by high forest cover closest to the nest (250 m), but negative effects of June precipitation on this variable proved to be significantly greater in open than in closed habitats, with results consistent at different scales, i.e. precipitation had greater negative effects on chick body condition in open than in closed landscapes. Precipitation is forecast to increase in the region as a result of climate change, hence forest cover could exert a positive role in mitigating adverse effects of unfavorable climatic conditions. Outcomes of this study may be used to inform sustainable timber harvest management strategies.",

		"abstract": "We compared northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis atricapillus) nesting habitat within 1 ha of nest sites and at landscape scales of 10, 30, 60, 83, 120, 150, and 170 ha in 4 study areas east of the Cascade Mountains in Oregon and Washington. Our objective was to describe goshawk nesting habitat at biologically relevant scales and to develop models capable of assessing the effects of forest management alternatives on habitat suitability. We evaluated habitat at 82 active goshawk nests and 95 random sites. Productivity (young fledged per nest) was evaluated at 81 nests. We collected data on forest structure within 1 ha of nests and random points. At scales ranging from 10 to 170 ha, we recorded the abundance and spatial distribution of several forest stages of stand development (i.e., stand initiation, stem exclusion, understory reinitiation, old growth) on aerial photographs. We used logistic regression and classification and regression trees (CART) to (1) evaluate habitat selection, (2) construct models to calculate the probability of nesting, and (3) explore relationships between reproductive output and habitat conditions. We assessed model accuracy via bootstrap and jackknife cross-validation techniques. By examining goshawk habitat relationships at multiple spatial scales across several study areas, we detected unifying spatial patterns and structural conditions surrounding goshawk nesting habitat. Our ability to discriminate goshawk nest sites from available habitat decreased as landscape scale increased, and different factors influenced goshawks at different scales. The presence and arrangement of forest structural types interacted to influence site suitability for nesting. At the 1-ha scale, the stage of stand development (i.e., stand initiation, stem exclusion, understory reinitiation, old growth), low topographic position, and tree basal area reliably discriminated between nests and random sites. Low topographic position and basal area were more influential than stand structure. At the landscape scale, modeling indicated that conditions at different scales interact to influence selection of habitat for nesting. A core area exists surrounding goshawk nests in which stem exclusion and understory reinitiation stands with canopy closure ≥50% serve as apparent protection against potentially detrimental effects associated with more open forest (e.g., predators and micro-climate). Among several models tested, the model that best discriminated between nests and random sites encompassed 83 ha surrounding the nest and incorporated habitat characteristics from multiple scales nested within that range. This model had a cross-validated classification accuracy of 75%. Positive correlations were found between fledging rate and tree basal area within 1 ha of the nest (<tex-math>$F_{3,77}=2.89$</tex-math>, P=0.0407), and between fledging rate and the percentage of landscape occupied by \"stem exclusion\" stands of low canopy closure (i.e., <50%) at landscape scales ≥60 ha (<tex-math>$F_{3,77}$</tex-math>, 0.041 ≤ P ≤ 0.089). Spatial modeling also showed that timber harvest can be managed to maintain or enhance goshawk nest site suitability over time in the Interior Northwest, and that a non-harvest strategy can be just as detrimental to nesting habitat as can be aggressive, maximum-yield forestry. We conclude that (1) northern goshawk nesting habitat becomes less distinguishable from the landscape with increasing area, and (2) habitat management based on exclusionary buffers should be re-evaluated in light of the way different habitat factors interact across spatial scales. We present case studies illustrating how landscape scale modeling can be implemented to (1) predict the influences of alternative silvicultural prescriptions on the suitability of potential nesting habitat over time, and (2) characterize large landscapes with respect to abundance and distribution of suitable nesting habitat.",

		"abstract": "The area used by immature birds from the time they fledge until independence is the post- fledging area (PFA). Published estimates of PFA size (170 ha) are only available from a Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis atricapillus) population in New Mexico and applicability of this estimate to other regions and habitat types is unknown. Our objectives were to estimate PFA size and length of the post-fledging period for Northern Goshawk (A. g. laingi) nests on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. We estimated PFA size from 95% adaptive kernel estimates of telemetry locations from 12 fledglings at 12 nests between 29June and 2 September 2001-02 (N = 6, 2001; N = 6, 2002). Because our adaptive kernel estimates are based on a small number of locations, we also estimated the precision of these home range estimates using a smoothed bootstrap approach. Almost all (93%) fledgling locations were within 200 m of nests during the early fledgling-dependency period, but less than half (42.4%) of these locations were within this distance during the late fledgling-dependency period. Northern Goshawks departed from PFAs 45.9 + 1.3 d post-fledging. Mean PFA size was 59.2 + 16.1 ha, and the bootstrapped variance around PFA estimates ranged from 12.7-1820.8 ha. Our estimate for the mean size of one PFA per nest area for A. g. laingi fledglings on Vancouver Island was much smaller than the mean size estimate reported for A. g. atricapillus in New Mexico. However, management plans should consider nest areas and PFAs to be one functional component of Northern Goshawk breeding habitat and should include multiple alternative nest trees, each with an associated PFA.",

		"abstract": "[The role of old-growth forest as a component of nesting habitat for northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) and the effect of timber harvest has come under increased scrutiny in the western United States. We examined the importance of selected elements of old-growth forest as nesting habitat for goshawks by comparing forest structure around 22 nests with 2 sets of random points. Comparisons were made at 6 spatial scales, from the nest stand up to a 170-ha post-fledging area (PFA). Goshawks nested more frequently in stands with dense canopy, late forest structure (i.e., trees >53 cm dbh, canopy closure >50%), and rarely in stands with mid-aged forest structure. Despite the occasional occurrence of goshawk nests in younger, more open-canopied stands, these conditions were less preferred than dense canopy, late forest structure. Late forest structure was more abundant within circles of 12 ha and 24 ha around nests than around random points. At the PFA scale, forest structure around nests was dominated by dense-canopied forest, always contained wet openings, and nests were positively associated with dry openings. Our findings support recent management recommendations for northern goshawks in the western United States, which call for maintaining the PFA in forest conditions intermediate between the high foliage volume and canopy cover of nest stands and more open foraging habitats. These conditions would provide nest sites for goshawks and habitat for a variety of prey species that inhabit late or early seral stage forest.]",

		"abstract": "Landscape pattern indicators or ‘metrics’ provide simple measures of landscape structure that can be easily calculated with readily available data and software. Unfortunately, the ecological relevance of many metrics (i.e. the relationship between metric values and the real-world ecological processes that they are meant to serve as proxies for) is often unproven and questionable, and concerns are regularly voiced that such metrics fail to capture important aspects of landscape function. In this paper, I provide a review of landscape measures that may better link landscape pattern and function, ranging from approaches that extend existing metrics by incorporating a more functional component (e.g. core area measures, least cost distances) to those rooted in graph, network, and electrical circuit theory. While more ‘functional’ approaches are becoming increasingly popular, the selection of appropriate landscape metrics in many applications involves tradeoffs regarding data requirements, ease of calculation, functional basis, and simplicity of interpretation by a range of specialist and non-specialist stakeholders. Regardless, there continues to be a need for landscape metrics because they are seen by many land managers and stakeholders as simple, intuitive tools for assessing and monitoring changes in landscape pattern and, by extension, the effects on underlying ecological processes. Future needs include: (1) the development of more user-friendly landscape analysis software that can simplify graph-based analyses and visualization; and (2) studies that clarify the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, including the potential limitations and biases in graph and network-based measures.",

		"abstract": "Conservation planners and land managers are often confronted with scale-associated challenges when assessing the relationship between land management objectives and species conservation. Conservation of individual species typically involves site-level analyses of habitat, whereas land management focuses on larger spatial extents. New models are needed to more explicitly integrate species-specific conservation with landscape or regional scales. We address this challenge with an example using the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), a forest raptor with circumpolar distribution that is the focus of intense debate regarding forest management on public lands in the southwestern USA. To address goshawk-specific habitat conservation across a management area of 22,800-km2 in northern Arizona, we focused on the territory scale rather than individual nest sites. We compiled a 17-year database of 895 nest sites to estimate territory locations. We then estimated the likelihood of territory occurrence for the entire management area using multiple logistic regression within an expert-driven, spatially balanced, and information-theoretic framework. Our occurrence model incorporated forest structure variables that were derived from USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis plots and high-resolution satellite imagery. Results indicated that high canopy-bulk density, intermediate canopy-base heights, and low variation in tree density were strong predictors of territory occurrence. We used model-averaged parameter estimates for these variables to map and explore patterns of territory distribution across multiple land jurisdictions and ecological subregions. Our iterative modeling approach complements previous demographic studies in the region. It also provides a robust framework for integrating species conservation and landscape management in ongoing and future regional planning efforts.",

		"abstract": "Large raptors such as northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) frequently have been the focus of conservation efforts because of their large area requirements and habitat sensitivity. We examined landscape-scale habitat selection of breeding goshawks and created a habitat model of goshawk landscape use in an area (1,600 km2) that contained forested, agricultural, and urban landscapes in northern Japan. From a systematic nest survey and extensive radio telemetry, we delineated 36 male home ranges (18 of them were approximated with similar-sized plots around nests) and 44 similar-sized unoccupied plots over the study area. The proportions of forest cover in each home range varied widely (between 2 and 88%). Despite this variation, goshawk landscape use was estimated accurately (classification accuracy = 84%) with a stepwise logistic regression model; the probability of occupancy was positively associated with the proportion of forest interior (>200 m from the forest edge) and that of open land <200 m from the forest edge, but it was negatively associated with the proportion of water and the mode of the slope. In home ranges, the proportions of forest interior and open land <200 m from forest edge complemented each other with the change in forest cover in such a way that the sum of the 2 variables always occupied >30% of the home ranges. These results suggest that a preference for the 2 different habitats, both of which may have a high prey availability, enables goshawks to nest in landscapes with a wide variety of forest fragmentation. The adverse effect of water on goshawk occupancy was due to the tendency of goshawks not to include a large river (>800 m wide) in their home ranges. This suggests that goshawks need connectivity between forest patches in their home ranges. The proportion of urban land was 19% lower in home ranges than in unoccupied plots. These results indicate that management efforts should focus on maintaining landscapes with high prey availability and connectivity between forest patches and on preventing urbanization over entire home ranges.",

		"abstract": "We used radiotelemetry to examine foraging habitat preferences of 17 breeding, male northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) in Minnesota from 1998-2000. We assessed habitat preference using radio relocation points and 50-m radius buffers of radio relocation points. Our data suggested that foraging male goshawks used early-successional upland conifer stands (≥25 yrs old), early-successional upland deciduous stands (≥50 yrs old), late-successional upland conifer stands (≥50 yrs old), and late-successional upland deciduous stands (≥50 yrs old) more frequently than expected based on the abundance of these vegetation types in the landscape. The 2 most available stand types, early-successional upland deciduous (<25 yrs old) and all ages of late-successional lowland conifer stands, were used less than expected by foraging goshawks. Late-successional lowland deciduous stands (≥50 yrs old) were used in proportion to availability. Although analysis of relocation points suggested early-successional upland deciduous stands (25-49 yrs old) and late-successional upland conifer stands (≥50 yrs old) were used in proportion to availability, analysis of buffers around relocation points indicated that these stand types were also used more than expected by foraging goshawks. Regardless of vegetation community type, stands used by goshawks were structurally similar with high canopy and understory stem densities, high canopy closure, substantial shrub cover, and large amounts of woody debris. Nest stands consisted of taller and larger diameter canopy trees and fewer understory trees than foraging stands, but stands were otherwise similar in structural features, suggesting goshawks used similar stands for nesting and foraging but that they tended to select the most mature stands for nesting. A commonality among nesting and foraging stands was the presence of open spaces between the canopy and understory foliage, and between understory and shrub layer foliage. In our study area, these spaces may have served as relatively unobstructed flight paths where foraging and nesting stands possessed stem densities at the upper end of that reported for goshawk habitat.",

		"abstract": "Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) are a species of special conservation concern in the western Great Lakes bioregion and elsewhere in North America, and exhibit landscape-scale spatial use patterns. However, little information exists about Northern Goshawk habitat relations at broad spatial extents, as most existing published information comes from a few locations of relatively small spatial extent and, in some cases, short durations. We used an information-theoretic approach to evaluate competing hypotheses regarding factors (forest canopy cover, successional stage, and heights of the canopy top and base) related to odds of Northern Goshawk landscape use throughout the western Great Lakes bioregion based on an occupancy survey completed in 2008 (Bruggeman et al. 2011). We also combined these data with historical data of Northern Goshawk nest locations in the bioregion from 1979–2006 to evaluate the same competing hypotheses to elucidate long-term trends in use. The odds of Northern Goshawk use in 2008, and from 1979–2008, were positively correlated with average percent canopy cover. In the best-approximating models developed using 1979–2008 data, the odds of landscape use were positively correlated with the percentages of the landscape having canopy heights between 10 m and 25 m, and 25 m and 50 m, and the amount of variability in canopy base height. Also, the odds of landscape use were negatively correlated with the average height at the canopy base. Our results suggest multiple habitat factors were related to Northern Goshawk landscape-scale habitat use, similar to habitat use described at smaller spatial scales in the western Great Lakes bioregion and in western North America and Europe.Accipiter gentilis es una especie de importancia especial de conservación en el oeste de la bio-región de los Grandes Lagos y en otros sitios de América del Norte y exhibe patrones de uso espacial a escala de paisaje. Sin embargo, existe poca información acerca de las relaciones de hábitat de A. gentilis en grandes extensiones espaciales, ya que la mayoría de la información publicada proviene de unos cuantos sitios de extensión espacial relativamente pequeña y, en algunos casos, de corta duración. Utilizamos un enfoque teórico-informativo para evaluar las hipótesis alternativas con respecto a factores (cobertura del dosel del bosque, estado sucesional y altura de la parte baja y alta del dosel) relacionados con las probabilidades de uso del paisaje de individuos de A. gentilis a lo largo de la bio-región de los Grandes Lagos, utilizando un censo de ocupación completado en 2008 (Bruggeman et al. 2011). También combinamos estos datos con datos históricos de localización de nidos de A. gentilis en la bio-región durante 1979–2006 para evaluar las mismas hipótesis alternativas para elucidar las tendencias de uso al largo plazo. Las probabilidades de uso por parte de A. gentilis en 2008, y de 1979 hasta 2008, estuvieron positivamente correlacionadas con el porcentaje promedio de cobertura del dosel. En los mejores modelos de aproximación desarrollados utilizando datos de 1979–2008, las probabilidades de uso del paisaje estuvieron positivamente correlacionadas con los porcentajes de paisaje que tenían alturas de dosel entre 10 m y 25 m y entre 25 m y 50 m, y con la cantidad de variabilidad en la altura de la base del dosel. Nuestros resultados sugieren que múltiples factores del hábitat estuvieron relacionados con el uso de hábitat a escala de paisaje por parte de A. gentilis, de modo similar al uso del hábitat descripto para escalas espaciales menores en la bio-región occidental de los Grandes Lagos y en el oeste de América del Norte y Europa.",

		"abstract": "[Edge effects are among the most extensively studied ecological phenomena, yet we lack a general, predictive framework to understand the patterns and variability observed. We present a conceptual model, based on resource distribution, that predicts whether organismal abundances near edges are expected to increase, decrease, or remain unchanged for any species at any edge type. Predictions are based on whether resources are found predominantly in one habitat (decreased abundance in preferred habitat, increase in non-preferred), divided between habitats (predicts an increase near both edges), spread equally among habitats (predicts a neutral edge response), or concentrated along the edge (increase). There are several implications of this model that can explain much of the variability reported in the edge literature. For instance, our model predicts that a species may show positive, negative, and neutral responses, depending on the edge type encountered, which explains some intraspecific variability observed in the literature. In addition, any predictable change in resource use (for example, by region or season) may explain temporal or spatial variability in responses even for the same species at the same edge type. We offer a preliminary test of our model by making predictions for 52 bird species from three published studies of abundance responses near forest edges. Predictions are based solely on general information about each species' habitat associations and resource use. Our model correctly predicted the direction of 25 out of 29 observed edge responses, although it tended to under-predict increases and over-predict decreases. This model is important because it helps make sense of a largely descriptive literature and allows future studies to be carried out under a predictive framework.]",

High-throughput sequencing (?HTS?) platforms now enable the rapid sequencing of DNA from diverse kinds of environmental samples (termed ?environmental DNA? or ?eDNA?).

Here, we review the use of eDNA metabarcoding for surveying animal and plant richness, and the challenges in using eDNA approaches to estimate relative abundance. We highlight eDNA applications in freshwater, marine and terrestrial environments, and in this broad context, we distill what is known about the ability of different eDNA sample types to approximate richness in space and across time. We provide guiding questions for study design and discuss the eDNA metabarcoding workflow with a focus on primers and library preparation methods. We additionally discuss important criteria for consideration of bioinformatic filtering of data sets, with recommendations for increasing transparency. Finally, looking to the future, we discuss emerging applications of eDNA metabarcoding in ecology, conservation, invasion biology, biomonitoring, and how eDNA metabarcoding can empower citizen science and biodiversity education.",

		"abstract": "Hummingbirds consume sugars from nectar, sap and honeydew, and obtain protein, fat and minerals from arthropods. To date, the identity of arthropod taxa in hummingbird diets has been investigated by observation of foraging or examination of alimentary tract contents. Direct examination of nestling provisioning adds the extra complication of disturbance to the young and mother. Here, we show that arthropod food items provisioned to Rufous hummingbird (Selasphorus rufus) nestlings can be identified by a safe and non-invasive protocol using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA from nestling fecal pellets collected post-fledging. We found that females on southern Vancouver Island (British Columbia, Canada) provisioned nestlings with a wide range of arthropod taxa. The samples examined contained three Classes, eight Orders, 48 Families, and 87 Genera, with from one to 15 Families being identified in a single pellet. Soft-bodied Dipterans were found most frequently and had the highest relative abundance; hard-bodied prey items were absent from almost all samples. Substantial differences in taxa were found within season and between years, indicating the importance of multi-year sampling when defining a prey spectrum.",

		"abstract": "In trophic studies on piscivorous birds, it is vital to know which kind of dietary sample provides the information of interest and how the prey can be identified reliably and efficiently. Often, noninvasively obtained dietary samples such as regurgitated pellets, feces, and regurgitated fish samples are the preferred source of information. Fish prey has usually been identified via morphological analysis of undigested hard parts, but molecular approaches are being increasingly used for this purpose. What remains unknown, however, is which dietary sample type is best suited for molecular diet analysis and how the molecular results compare to those obtained by morphological analysis. Pellets, feces, and regurgitated fish samples of Great Cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) were examined for prey using both morphological hard part analysis and molecular prey identification. The sample types and methods were compared regarding number of species detected (overall and per sample) as well as the prey species composition and its variability among individual samples. Via molecular analysis, significantly higher numbers of prey species were detected in pellets, feces, and fish samples. Of the three sample types, pellets contained the most comprehensive trophic information and could be obtained with the lowest sampling effort. Contrastingly, dietary information obtained from feces was least informative and most variable. For all sample types, the molecular approach outperformed morphological hard part identification regarding the detectable prey spectrum and prey species composition. We recommend the use of pellets in combination with molecular prey identification to study the diet of piscivorous birds.",

		"abstract": "As central place foragers, breeding penguins are restricted in foraging range by the need to return to the colony to feed chicks. Furthermore, breeding birds must balance energetic gain from self-feeding with the costs of returning to provision young. Non-breeding birds, however, are likely to be less restricted in foraging range and lack the high energy demands of provisioning, therefore may consume different prey to breeders. We used DNA dietary analysis to determine whether there was a difference in provisioning and self-feeding diet by identifying prey DNA in scat samples from breeding and chick Adélie penguins at two locations in East Antarctica. We also investigated diet differences between breeders and non-breeders at one site. Although previous work shows changing foraging behaviour between chick provisioning and self-feeding, our results suggest no significant differences in the main prey groups consumed by chicks and breeders at either site or between breeding stages. This may reflect the inability of penguins to selectively forage when provisioning, or resources were sufficient for all foraging needs. Conversely, non-breeders were found to consume different prey groups to breeders, which may reflect less restricted foraging ranges, breeders actively selecting particular prey during breeding or reduced foraging experience of non-breeders.",

		"abstract": "[1. Because of their popular appeal, top vertebrate predators have frequently been used as flagship or umbrella species to acquire financial support, raise environmental awareness and plan systems of protected areas. However, some have claimed that the utilization of charismatic predators may divert a disproportionate amount of funding to a few glamorous species without delivering broader biodiversity benefits, an accusation aggravated by the fact that the conservation of top predators is often complex, difficult and expensive. Therefore, tests are needed of whether apex predators may be employed to achieve ecosystem-level targets. 2. To test such a hypothesis, we compared the biodiversity values recorded at the breeding sites of six raptor species, differing widely in diet and habitat associations, with those observed at three types of control locations, (i) sites randomly chosen in comparable habitat, (ii) breeding sites of a randomly selected bird species of lower trophic level and (iii) breeding sites of a lower trophic level species with specialized ecological requirements. Biodiversity was measured as the richness and evenness of bird, butterfly and tree species. 3. Biodiversity levels were consistently higher at sites occupied by top predators than at any of the three types of control sites. Furthermore, sites occupied by top predators also held greater densities of individual birds and butterflies (all species combined) than control sites. 4. In a reserve-selection simulation exercise, networks of protected sites constructed on the basis of top predators were more efficient than networks based on lower trophic level species, enabling higher biodiversity coverage to be achieved with a smaller number of reserves. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide evidence of a link between the strategic utilization of top predatory species and ecosystem-level conservation. We suggest that, at least in some biological systems, conservation plans based on apex predators could be implemented to deliver broader biodiversity benefits.]",

		"abstract": "Animal territories that differ in the availability of food resources will require (all other things being equal) different levels of effort for successful reproduction. As a consequence, breeding performance may become most strongly dependent on factors that affect individual foraging where resources are poor. We investigated potential links between foraging behaviour, reproductive performance and morphology in a goshawk Accipiter gentilis population, which experienced markedly different resource levels in two different parts of the study area (rabbit-rich vs. rabbit-poor areas). Our analyses revealed (1) that rabbit abundance positively affected male reproductive output; (2) that age, size and rabbit abundance (during winter) positively affected different components of female reproductive output; (3) that foraging movements were inversely affected by rabbit abundance for both sexes (for females, this may mainly have reflected poor provisioning by males in the rabbit-poor area); (4) that younger breeders (both in males and females) tended to move over larger distances than older individuals (which may have reflected both a lack of hunting experience and mate searching); and (5) that male body size (wing length) showed some covariation with resource conditions (suggesting possible adaptations to hunting agile avian prey in the rabbit-poor area). Although we are unable to establish firm causal relationships with our observational data set, our results provide an example of how territory quality (here, food abundance) and individual features (here, age and morphology) may combine to shape a predator's foraging behaviour and, ultimately, its breeding performance.",

		"abstract": "Abstract: We responded to the claim by Greenwald et al. (2005) that the management recommendations for the northern goshawk in the Southwestern United States (MRNG; Reynolds et al. 1992), a food web-based conservation plan that incorporated both northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and multiple prey habitats, may be inadequate to protect goshawks. Greenwald et al. (2005) based this claim on their review of 12 telemetry studies of goshawk habitat selection and 5 nontelemetry studies of the effects of vegetation structure at the home range scale on goshawk nest occupancy and reproduction that appeared after the 1992 publication of the MRNG. Greenwald et al. (2005) summarized their review as showing that 1) goshawks were habitat specialists limited to forests with mature and old-growth structures including large trees, high canopy cover, multiple canopy layering, and abundant woody debris; 2) habitats were not selected on the basis of prey abundance and, therefore, managing for prey habitats diluted goshawk habitats; and 3) selection for openings, edges, and habitat diversity was inconclusive. Our review found that when the studies' respective authors pooled their radiotagged goshawks there were weak to strong selections for old forest structures. However, the studies also documented extensive variation in use of vegetation types and structures by individual goshawks; some avoided openings, edges, young forests, and old forests, whereas others selected for these characteristics. Additionally, by virtue of their wide geographic distribution, the studies showed that the focal populations themselves occurred in a variety of forest types, some with large structural differences. We found no evidence in Greenwald's et al. (2005) review that the MRNG are inadequate to protect goshawks. Rather, the studies reviewed by Greenwald et al. (2005), as well as many studies they missed, supported the MRNG. The suggestion of inadequacy by Greenwald et al. (2005) appeared rooted in misunderstandings of goshawk habitats described in the MRNG, a discounting of the extent of variation in vegetation structural and seral stages used by goshawks, a limited understanding of the extent to which prey limits goshawks, a failure to recognize the dynamic nature of forests, and an incomplete review of the literature. We believe the MRNG are adequate because they maximize the sustainable amount of mature and old forests in goshawk home ranges and specify the kinds and intermixtures of prey habitats within home ranges. Implementation of MRNG should reduce the likelihood that the availability of vegetation structures suited to goshawk nesting and foraging, as well as abundance and availability of prey, will limit goshawk nest occupancy and reproduction.",

		"abstract": "[In long-lived raptors, research suggests that some nest areas consistently fledge more young than others, with the majority of young in the population being produced by a few females. If this claim were true for Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) populations, it would benefit land managers to identify high-quality goshawk breeding habitat. We examined whether the number of young fledged varied spatially among Northern Goshawk nest areas within three study areas where long-term reproductive data from goshawks were available: (1) Vancouver Island, British Columbia; (2) Jemez Mountains, New Mexico; and (3) Uinta Mountains, Utah. A mixed-model ANOVA indicated there was minimal spatial variation in nest productivity among nest areas within the three study locations. Rather, nest areas exhibited high temporal variability in nest productivity within each study area. These results suggest that temporal patterns such as local weather and fluctuating prey populations influenced Northern Goshawk reproduction more than spatial patterns such as habitat characteristics. Nest productivity may inadequately reflect spatial patterns in goshawk reproduction and so it would be premature to assume that habitat quality for Northern Goshawks was equal among nest areas within these study areas. Future research should examine spatial variability among nest areas in adult and juvenile survival rates to gain a complete picture of population responses to habitat change. /// Investigaciones en aves rapaces longevas sugieren que consistentemente más polluelos empluman en algunos sitios de anidación que en otros y que la mayoría de los juveniles en la población son producidos por unas pocas hembras. Si esto fuera cierto para poblaciones de Accipiter gentilis, ayudaría a las autoridades ambientales a identificar hábitat reproductivo de alta calidad para la especie. Evaluamos si el número de polluelos emplumados varió espacialmente entre sitios de anidación de A. gentilis dentro de tres áreas de estudio para las cuales había datos reproductivos de largo plazo disponibles: (1) Vancouver Island, British Columbia; (2) Jemez Mountains, New Mexico; y (3) Uinta Mountains, Utah. Un modelo mixto de análisis de varianza indicó que la variación espacial en la productividad de los nidos entre sitios de anidación dentro de las tres áreas de estudio fue mínima. En cambio, los sitios de anidación presentaron una alta variabilidad temporal en la productividad de los nidos dentro de cada área de estudio. Estos resultados sugieren que los patrones temporales como el clima y las fluctuaciones de las poblaciones de presas influencian la reproducción de A. gentilis más que los patrones espaciales como las características del hábitat. La productividad de los nidos puede reflejar inadecuadamente los patrones espaciales de la reproducción de A. gentilis, de modo que sería prematuro suponer que la calidad de hábitat fue igual entre los sitios de anidación dentro de las áreas de estudio. Para tener una perspectiva completa de la respuesta de las poblaciones a cambios en el ambiente, investigaciones futuras deberían examinar la variabilidad espacial entre sitios de anidación en las tasas de supervivencia de aves adultas y juveniles.]",

		"abstract": "[(1) Diets of three nesting raptor species were evaluated from 5939 prey items collected from nests in south-western Idaho during a 10-year period that included a complete jack rabbit population cycle and an unusual ground squirrel population crash. (2) Jack rabbits were the principal prey of golden eagles; Townsend's ground squirrels were the main prey of prairie falcons and red-tailed hawks. Prairie falcons had the most specialized diets, and red-tailed hawks the most diverse. None of the three raptor diets reflected the relative abundance of prey types in the environment. (3) Diet diversity of each of the three raptor species expanded as the abundance of their main prey declined. Ground squirrels and birds were alternate prey for eagles; gopher snakes, kangaroo rats, and rabbits were alternate prey for red-tailed hawks. Prairie falcons had no single important alternate prey species. (4) Yearly frequencies of main prey in each of the three raptor diets were correlated with the annual abundance of that prey in the environment. Frequencies of alternate prey were correlated not with their own abundance but inversely with the abundance of the principal prey. (5) Eagle preference for jack rabbits was strong and unaffected by changes in prey densities. Red-tailed hawk selectivity for jack rabbits was inversely related to ground squirrel abundance, suggesting `switching' behaviour. Prairie falcon selectivity for ground squirrels did not vary with ground squirrel densities. (6) Prey choice was generally consistent with predictions of the original optimal diet model, but red-tailed hawk prey selection appeared to depend on relative prey densities. Degree of diet specialization and plasticity are probably related to a raptor's life-history characteristics, and may influence a raptor's effects on its prey populations.]",

		"abstract": "A critical element of diet analysis is species adaptability to alternative prey sources. The breeding-season diet of Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) includes both mammalian and avian species, varies geographically, and is often dependent upon tree squirrels of the genera Sciurus and Tamiasciurus. We studied alternative prey sources of Northern Goshawks in the South Hills of south-central Idaho, an area where tree squirrels are naturally absent and other prey frequently important in the diet of goshawks, such as smaller corvids, are uncommon. We quantified the diet of goshawks using nest cameras and surveyed abundance of prey using line transects. We found that goshawks consumed roughly 18.5% birds and 78.7% mammals by biomass, with diet dominated by the Belding's ground squirrel (Urocitellus beldingi, also known as Spermophilus beldingi; 74.8% of total biomass consumed); however, the percentages of mammals and birds in the diet varied between years. The diet was low in diversity, with high overlap among nests, indicating a strong local dependence on the dominant food item. Lastly, the proportion of mammalian prey in the diet was greater in larger broods than in smaller broods. This study provides new insight into the adaptability of the goshawk, particularly in areas with unique prey assemblages.",

		"abstract": "(1) Four released goshawks were radio-tracked for up to 29 days at a time in Oxfordshire. Their hunting flights were mostly at 3--4 min intervals, for an average of 200 m in open country. They remained in woodland for 50% of the time although only 12% of their ranges was wooded. This preference resulted not from hawks flying less frequently in woodland, but because they flew half the distance between perches and doubled back twice as often in woodland as in open country. (2) Most attacks were initiated from perches, and only 3% were at prey already in flight. Six percent of observed attacks were successful, but hawks were most successful when hunting out of sight. They killed, on average, once in every 262 minutes of hunting. Seventy percent of prey was taken in or from woodland, a higher proportion than expected from the time spent there. (3) There were no sex or age differences in the preference for woodland of twenty-two wild goshawks radio-tracked in Sweden. Woodland within 200 m of open country was the most preferred habitat, and the majority of kills were made there. Range size was related to the proportion of a range that was woodland edge, and to prey availability. It is suggested that hawks covered the amount of woodland edge which gave adequate kills at the prevailing prey density, range size then being the area which happened to include that amount of woodland edge.",

		"abstract": "The U.S. Forest Service recently recommended managing forests to increase the abundance of prey for Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) in the southwestern United States. However, empirical data are needed to indicate whether goshawks select foraging habitat based on prey abundance, on the presence of forest structures that favor their hunting\nstrategy, or both. During the 1993 and 1994 breeding seasons, we indexed prey abundance and measured forest structure at sites used by radio-tagged goshawks and at nearby paired\nsites that lacked evidence of goshawk use (contrast plots). Goshawks apparently did not select foraging sites based on prey abundance; indeed, abundances of some prey were lower\non used than on contrast plots. Goshawks selected foraging sites that had higher canopy closure (P 5 0.006), greater tree density (P 5 0.001), and greater density of trees .40.6\ncm dbh (P , 0.0005) than on contrast plots. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that goshawk morphology and behavior are adapted for hunting in moderately dense, mature forests, and that prey availability (as determined by the occurrence of favorable vegetation\nstructure where prey are present above a low threshold) is more important than prey density in habitat selection. Nonetheless, current management recommendations for increasing prey\nabundance also can create a forest structure more favorable for hunting by goshawks, particularly if stands are managed for canopy closure values above the prescribed minimum\nlevel of 40% canopy.",

		"abstract": "The northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) has been the subject of considerable interest because of the impact of logging on this species' nesting habitat. However, few studies have examined movements of fledgling birds around the nest prior to independence, and even fewer have described resource requirements of young birds during their postfledging period. Over 3 years, we followed 31 radiotagged goshawk fledglings from 15 nests in southeastern British Columbia, Canada. Of these birds, 26 survived to disperse. Between fledging and dispersal 95% of fledgling relocations (n  =  1,148) were within 450 m of the nest. Fledglings primarily remained within 298 m of the nest during the first 21 days postfledging and within 525 m of the nest between 21 days postfledging and dispersal. Fledglings' movements were highly directional, with individual and sibling movements away from any particular nest tending out in one direction. Postfledging areas averaged 36.7 ha in size (median  =  23.1, inter-quartile range  =  20.8–39.7 ha). Fledglings strongly avoided forest <40 years old and weakly selected young forests (40–80 yr), mature forests (>80 yr), and stands with >40% canopy cover during the first 21 days and after. We suggest forest managers wishing to conserve goshawk postfledging areas in the interior montane forests of British Columbia maintain forests >40 years old with high crown closure covering an area ≥21 ha and preferably >40 ha. This area should contain all identified occupied and alternative nest trees in a nest area. At least half this area should be forest >80 years old and contain existing nests and potential for future nest trees.",

		"abstract": "[In the 1990s the federal forests in the Pacific Northwest underwent the largest shift in management focus since their creation, from providing a sustained yield of timber to conserving biodiversity, with an emphasis on endangered species. Triggered by a legal challenge to the federal protection strategy for the Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), this shift was facilitated by a sequence of science assessments that culminated in the development of the Northwest Forest Plan. The plan, adopted in 1994, called for an extensive system of late-successional and riparian reserves along with some timber harvest on the intervening lands under a set of controls and safeguards. It has proven more successful in stopping actions harmful to conservation of old-growth forests and aquatic systems than in achieving restoration goals and economic and social goals. We make three suggestions that will allow the plan to achieve its goals: (1) recognize that the Northwest Forest Plan has evolved into an integrative conservation strategy, (2) conserve old-growth trees and forests wherever they occur, and (3) manage federal forests as dynamic ecosystems.]",

		"abstract": "[The U.S. Forest Service manages most southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) for forest structures designed to increase abundance of prey for northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis). The rationale for this strategy is a hypothesis that goshawk populations are limited by prey abundance. However, Beier and Drennan (1997) found that during the breeding season goshawks selected foraging sites not for higher prey abundance but for higher canopy closure, greater tree density, and greater density of trees >40.6 cm diameter at breast height (dbh). This finding supports the argument that prey availability (as determined by forest structure suited to goshawk maneuverability and hunting behavior) is more important than prey abundance. During winter, goshawks are under greater thermal stress, most avian prey have migrated, and most mammalian prey are hibernating. Under these conditions, foraging habitats may differ from those described for the breeding season. We radiotracked 13 adult goshawks (6 F, 7 M) during 2 winters (1994-1995 and 1995-1996) to investigate seasonal movements, winter diet, and selection of foraging habitat. Most females continued to use their breeding-season home ranges in ponderosa pine forest during winter. Meanwhile, most males moved into lower-elevation pinyon-juniper forest. In contrast to the high prey diversity noted during breeding season, wintering goshawks specialized on only 2 species of large-bodied prey (cottontails [Sylvilagus spp.] and Abert squirrel [Sciurus aberti]). Goshawks minimized energy expense and thermal exposure of flight by caching and feeding behavior. Sites where goshawks foraged had more medium-sized trees (P = 0.06) and denser canopy closure (P = 0.06) than nearby reference plots that lacked evidence of goshawk use. However, indices of prey abundance were nearly equal at used and reference plots. Although our findings do not support the underlying premise of the Forest Service management strategy for goshawks, we have no evidence that goshawks will experience lower survival or fecundity under such management. Regardless of the impact of management on goshawk fitness, we question the policy of managing most ponderosa pine habitat in the Southwest United States based on the needs of this species alone.]",

		"abstract": "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) was petitioned in 1997 to consider listing Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis atricapillus) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, west of the 100th meridian of the contiguous United States. In their 12-mo finding issued in June 1998, the FWS determined that listing this population as threatened or endangered was not warranted and based that decision on review existing population and habitat information. Because the status of goshawks in the western U.S. continues to be contentious and the FWS finding has been challenged, the Raptor Research Foundation, Inc. and The Wildlife Society jointly formed a committee to review information regarding the status of the goshawk population in the contiguous U.S. west of the 100th meridian. The committee was requested to: (1) determine if there is evidence of a population trend in goshawks in the western U.S., excluding Alaska; (2) determine if there is evidence that goshawks nesting in the eastern and western U.S. represent distinctive, genetically unique populations; and (3) evaluate evidence for goshawk-habitat relations, including any association with large, mostly-unbroken tracts of old growth and mature forests. Based on existing information, the committee concluded: (1) existing data are not adequate to assess population trend in goshawks west of the 100th meridian; (2) existing analyses of phylogeography have not provided evidence of genetic differences among recognized (atricapillus, laingi) or putative (apache) subspecies, and the genetic distinctness of atricapillus goshawks in western and eastern North America is not known; and (3) at present, assessing the status of goshawks solely using distribution of late-successional forests is not appropriate, based on the current understanding of goshawk-habitat relations, although goshawks clearly use and often select late-successional forests for nesting and foraging. We provide recommendations on information needs to assess status and population trend of goshawks in the western U.S. ?? 2005 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.",

		"abstract": "Abstract The northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis atricapillus) is a woodland raptor that uses a variety of forest types for nesting across its breeding range, but strongly depends on older forests with large trees and open understories. Goshawks may select nesting locations by maximizing the convergence of nesting and foraging habitats. Insights into goshawk responses to heterogeneous landscapes can be gained by examining the location of active nest sites through time and at multiple spatial scales. We examined the landscape-scale forest conditions that influenced the probability of active goshawk nests in the United States Forest Service, Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest (CNNF) in northern Wisconsin. We used goshawk nest survey and monitoring data from 1997 to 2006 to determine the probability of an active nest site over time in relation to forest composition and road density at 3 scales (200-m, 500-m, and 1,000-m radii). Goshawk nests were located primarily in upland hardwood (64%), conifer (23%), and older aspen?birch (≥26 yrs old; 11%) habitat cover types. We used Bayesian temporal autoregressive models of nest locations across multiple spatial scales to analyze these data. The probability of active goshawk nest occurrence increased with increasing conifer cover (1,000?m) and decreased with increasing cover of older aspen?birch and density of primary roads (500?m). In addition, lesser proportions of older aspen?birch at intermediate scales around goshawk nests had a stronger effect on the probability of a nest being active than conifer and primary roads. Thus, the ratio of conifer cover (within 1,000?m) to older aspen?birch cover (within 500?m) in landscapes surrounding nest sites was the key driver in predicting the probability of an active nest site. This finding can be used by forest managers to help sustain the active status of a goshawk nesting area through time (i.e., annually), and foster goshawk nesting activity in areas where active nesting is not currently occurring.

		"abstract": "With biodiversity facing threats, there is a need to improve reserve selection procedures. However, detailed information about different biodiversity measures (e.g. species richness) at potential sites is often lacking, and selecting areas that protect most biodiversity is difficult. To simplify matters, biodiversity surrogate species, that is, species associated with higher biodiversity than average, have been used for area selection. However, consensus about the performance of the surrogate species concept is lacking, and there are few studies investigating potential differences in the effectiveness of multiple predators as surrogates for biodiversity over large spatial scales. We evaluated two avian predators, the northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis and the Ural owl Strix uralensis, as surrogates for biodiversity in the boreal forest biome in Western Finland. We used a study design including nest sites and two reference sites for each nest, the diversity of birds and wood-decaying fungi (polypores). We assessed simultaneously whether surrogacy persisted at the landscape level while moving from one vegetation zone to another. We generally found more birds and polypores around the nest sites for both goshawks and Ural owls than at their respective reference sites. However, the goshawk outperformed the Ural owl. Additionally, although biodiversity was found to decrease at the landscape scale as a result of a decrease in vegetation complexity with increasing longitude, the surrogacy efficiency of the raptors remained unchanged. Synthesis and applications. These findings suggest that the surrogate species concept applied to raptors may be an efficient addition to methods for identifying areas of conservation priority, even across vegetation zones. We conclude that protecting areas around raptor nests is a method to consider in order to halt forest biodiversity loss. Finally, sampling biodiversity along diversity and landscape gradients can improve the necessary assessment of surrogate species.",

		"abstract": "[Although species with large area requirements are sometimes used as umbrella species, their general utility as conservation tools is uncertain. We surveyed the species diversity of birds, butterflies, carabids, and forest-floor plants in forest sites across an area $(1600 km^2)$ in which we delineated large breeding home ranges of Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis). We tested whether protection of the home ranges could serve as an effective umbrella to protect sympatric species of the four taxa. We also used an empirical habitat model of occupancy of home range to examine mechanisms by which the Northern Goshawk acts as an umbrella species. Among species richness, abundance, and species composition of the four taxa, only abundance and species composition of birds differed between sites located inside and outside home ranges, which was due to greater abundance of bird species that were prey of Northern Goshawks inside the home ranges. Thus, although home range indicated areas with high abundance of certain bird prey species, it was not effective as an indicator of the species diversity of all four taxa. We also did not find any difference in species richness, abundance, and species composition between sites predicted as occupied and unoccupied using the habitat model. In contrast, when we selected sites on the basis of each habitat variable in the model, habitat variables that selected sites either in agricultural or forested landscapes encompassed sites with high species richness or particular species composition. This result suggests that the low performance of the Northern Goshawk as an umbrella species is due to this species' preference for habitat in both agricultural and forested landscapes. Species that can adjust to changes in habitat conditions may not act as effective umbrella species despite having large home ranges.]",

		"abstract": "[In the face of limited funding, knowledge, and time for action, conservation efforts often rely on shortcuts for the maintenance of biodiversity. The umbrella species concept-proposed as a way to use species requirements as a basis for conservation planning-has recently received growing attention. We reviewed the literature to evaluate the concept's general usefulness. An umbrella species is defined as a species whose conservation is expected to confer protection to a large number of naturally co-occurring species. This concept has been proposed as a tool for determining the minimum size for conservation areas, selecting sites to be included in reserve networks, and setting minimum standards for the composition, structure, and processes of ecosystems. Among the species suggested as potential umbrellas, most are large mammals and birds, but invertebrates are increasingly being considered. Eighteen research papers, most of which were based on hypothetical reserves or conservation networks, have provided evaluations of umbrella species schemes. These show that single-species umbrellas cannot ensure the conservation of all co-occurring species because some species are inevitably limited by ecological factors that are not relevant to the umbrella species. Moreover, they provide evidence that umbrella species from a given higher taxon may not necessarily confer protection to assemblages from other taxa. On the other hand, multi-species strategies based on systematic selection procedures (e.g., the focal species approach) offer more compelling evidence of the usefulness of the concept. Evaluations of umbrella species schemes could be improved by including measures of population viability and data from many years, as well as by comparing the efficiency of the proposed scheme with alternative management strategies.]",

		"abstract": "ABSTRACT Landscape ecology is based on the premise that there are strong links between ecological pattern and ecological function and process. Ecological systems are spatially heterogeneous, exhibiting considerable complexity and variability in time and space. This variability is typically represented by categorical maps or by a collection of samples taken at specific spatial locations (point data). Categorical maps quantize variability by identifying patches that are relatively homogeneous and that exhibit a relatively abrupt transition to adjacent areas. Alternatively, point-data analysis (geostatistics) assumes that the system property is spatially continuous, making fewer assumptions about the nature of spatial structure. Each data model provides capabilities that the other does not, and they should be considered complementary. Although the concept of patches is intuitive and consistent with much of ecological theory, point-data analysis can answer two of the most critical questions in spatial pattern analysis: what is the appropriate scale to conduct the analysis, and what is the nature of the spatial structure? I review the techniques to evaluate categorical maps and spatial point data, and make observations about the interpretation of spatial pattern indices and the appropriate application of the techniques. Pattern analysis techniques are most useful when applied and interpreted in the context of the organism(s) and ecological processes of interest, and at appropriate scales, although some may be useful as coarse-filter indicators of ecosystem function. I suggest several important needs for future research, including continued investigation of scaling issues, development of indices that measure specific components of spatial pattern, and efforts to make point-data analysis more compatible with ecological theory.",

		"abstract": "[Human-caused fragmentation of forests is increasing, yet the consequences of these landscape changes to vertebrate communities are poorly understood. Although bird community response to forest fragmentation caused by agricultural or urban development has been well studied, we have little understanding of these dynamics in landscapes undergoing intensive forest management, where late-seral forest stands are separated by younger forest stands of varying ages and are part of a spatially and temporally dynamic forest landscape. We investigated the relationship between landscape structure and breeding bird abundance in the central Oregon Coast Range. We sampled vegetation and birds in 30 landscapes (250-300 ha) distributed equally among three basins. Landscapes represented a range in structure based on the proportion of the landscape in a late-seral forest condition and the spatial configuration of that forest condition within the landscape. We computed a variety of landscape metrics from digital vegetation cover maps for each landscape. Using analysis of variance and regression procedures, we quantified the independent effects of habitat area and configuration on 15 bird species associated with late-seral forest. Species varied dramatically in the strength and nature of the relationship between abundance and several gradients in habitat area and configuration at the landscape scale. Landscape structure (composition and configuration) typically explained <50% of the variation in each species' abundance among the landscapes. Species' abundances were generally greater in the more heterogenous landscapes; that is, they were associated with the more fragmented distribution of habitat. Only Winter Wrens showed evidence of association with the least fragmented landscapes. These results must be interpreted within the scope and limitations of our study. In particular, the scale of our analysis was constrained by the lower and upper limits of resolution in our landscapes, as set by minimum patch size and landscape extent, respectively. Thus, our results do not preclude much stronger and different relationships at finer and/or coarser scales. In addition, our community-centered habitat classification scheme and artificially discrete representation of patch boundaries may not have captured the functionally meaningful heterogeneity for each species. Finally, our analysis was limited to relatively common and widespread diurnal breeding bird species. Species sensitive to habitat fragmentation at the scale of our analysis may have been rare already and therefore not subject to the parametrical statistical approach that we employed.]",

		"abstract": "[Systematic pellet-group counts for big game trend, census, and distribution originated in the late 1930's and have since been used for a variety of research and management objectives. Their chief advantage is that pellet groups can be sampled by standard field plot techniques. Most pellet-group plots have been circles or long narrow rectangles, usually distributed in some form of stratified-random design. Sample plot layout can often be planned to minimize variance between plots or groups of plots. Sampling technique will depend upon local objectives, but some guidelines have been recognized. Sampling is generally more efficient in areas of higher pellet-group density. If pellet groups are distributed uniformly, a large area may require no more plots for adequate sampling than a small area. Pellet groups generally are deposited in a clumped pattern. Sampling intensity estimates can be made on the basis of the mean and variance derived from preliminary sample counts. Daily defecation rate is needed for computing deer-days use or total numbers of deer. Available data on defecation rate for wild native North American ruminants is tabulated, with some information on livestock and one exotic, the Barbary sheep. High defecation rate in deer has been observed to accompany high feed intake, high forage moisture content, high percentage of young in the herd, change in diet from roughage to concentrates, and the psychological impact of captivity. Observer bias arises mainly from differences in interpretation and from missed groups. Because of missed groups most counts will underestimate actual pellet-group density. Missed groups error is influenced by plot size and shape, type and density of understory vegetation, and observer fatigue and inherent visual acuity. Sources of interpretational differences include decisions concerning peripheral groups, scattered groups, and the minimum number of pellets to be counted as a group. Common practice requires use of permanently marked plots which are periodically cleared. Temporary plots are sometimes used where the deposition period can be dated by reference to leaf-fall, by deformation of pellets due to emergence of succulent feed, or by estimation of the period of herd occupancy of seasonal range. Such dating schemes introduce an additional source of observer bias. Pellet group counts have been unworkable at times because of rapid loss of pellets by insect attack or heavy rains, because of difficulties in identifying pellets of different species, or because of extremely dense vegetation. In a few cases the pellet group count has been tested against known numbers of deer in fenced areas, or against other census techniques. Reasonable accuracy of estimate has been obtained in many cases.]",

		"abstract": "Northern goshawk (Queen Charlotte subspecies: Accipiter gentilis laingi) inventory and research occurred onVancouver Island, B.C. from 1994 to 1998. Broadcast surveys, the most effective inventory method known forgoshawks, continue to be time-consuming and costly, with a relatively low number of goshawk detections and nestlocations per unit of effort. Since 1994, approximately 2,912 broadcast stations resulted in 51 goshawk detectionsand the location of 19 nest territories. Twelve other goshawk territories were reported by forestry workers andmembers of the public, 3 were found using radiotelemetry, and another was discovered using the stand-watchinventory technique, increasing the number of currently known goshawk territories on Vancouver Island to 35.Territory occupancy rates appear to vary by year, and may relate to the seral stage of the nesting habitat and to thedegree of fragmentation in the surrounding landscape. Research efforts on Vancouver Island have focused ondescribing the habitat characteristics of goshawk nest sites, nest stands, and home ranges, and on identifying theirmain prey items. As well, radiotelemetry is being used to gain information on goshawks’ breeding and winter homerange size and habitat use, territory and mate fidelity, breeding dispersal, and mortality rates. Future directions forgoshawk research on Vancouver Island include: 1) testing the effectiveness of a new broadcast call for goshawkinventory; 2) testing the effectiveness of dawn vocalizations to determine territory occupancy and to locate activenest sites; and 3) examining nest productivity and territory occupancy in relation to the percent of old-growth anddegree of fragmentation in goshawk breeding home ranges. This research aims to improve our ability to locategoshawk nest territories, gain a better understanding of population size on Vancouver Island, and increase ourknowledge of habitat quality for goshawks. Using this information, current management strategies for goshawksmay be refined to reflect the conclusions of local, scientific studies.",

It cannot be used everywhere, as it does not always give values which are independent of sample size ; it cannot do so, for example, when applied to an infinite population of individuals classified into a finite number of groups.

In the coastal mountains of northwestern Oregon only Sharp-shinned Hawks (Accipiter striatus) and Cooper's Hawks (A. cooperii) nested. In the remainder of the state, A. striatus, A. cooperii, and Northern Goshawks (A. gentilis) were syntopic during the nesting season. The number of species and the total density of birds in eastern Oregon were about one-half those in northwestern Oregon. Mean prey size of A. striatus in northwestern Oregon (12.8 g) was significantly smaller than that of the same species in eastern Oregon (28.4 g). Accipiter striatus diets in both areas were composed almost entirely of birds (<5% mammals). Mean prey size of A. cooperii in both areas was nearly the same (134.7 g vs. 136.3 g) and was significantly larger than mean prey size of A. striatus. The frequency of occurrence and the size of prey taxa in A. cooperii diets, however, varied between areas: 74% birds (x̄ = 79.2 g) and 25% mammals (x̄ = 296.4 g) in northwestern Oregon versus 47% birds (x̄ = 123.7 g) and 53% mammals (x̄ = 147.5 g) in eastern Oregon. Mean prey size of A. gentilis in eastern Oregon (306.6 g) was significantly larger than that of A. cooperii and consisted of 55% birds (x̄ = 195.5 g) and 45% mammals (x̄ = 445.2 g). An analysis of prey sizes, prey taxa, and foraging heights indicated that, in general, food was partitioned in both areas primarily according to prey size. In eastern Oregon, however, where A. cooperii and A. gentilis overlapped broadly in prey size, these species tended to take different prey taxa. Both A. cooperii and A. gentilis foraged primarily in the lower zones (ground-shrub and shrub-canopy), whereas A. striatus foraged in the upper canopy.]",

		"abstract": "[(1) When the breeding population had settled, female sparrowhawks were removed from seven different nesting territories, and males from seven other territories in southern Scotland. In the same season, three of the removed females were subsequently replaced by other females, and three or four of the males were replaced by other males. (2) All three replacement females laid eggs, but only one (the oldest with previous breeding experience) produced young. Only one of the pairs with replaced males got beyond nest-building, but none raised young. The breeding success of the replacement birds was significantly lower than that of the remaining population. (3) As no movements were recorded from surrounding territories, and migrants were unknown in the area, it was assumed that the replacement birds were resident sparrowhawks that would otherwise not have attempted to breed that year. They included some first-year birds and some older ones, at least one of which had bred in the area in previous years. Replacement occurred even though unused nesting territories existed nearby. This raises the question why these birds had not already taken one of these unused territories and nested. Quality of available territory may be involved, as all replacements were on territories where previous use and nest success had been high. It is suggested that certain (mainly young) birds which are less efficient hunters can attempt to breed only if they can find a vacancy in good habitat (with a rich food supply), but not if the only habitat available to them is poor. In other words, an interaction between habitat quality and bird quality influences whether breeding occurs.]",

		"abstract": "Factors linked with intraspecific variation in trophic diversity are still poorly understood in generalist species like the Montagu’s harrier (Circus pygargus) but may have important implications for conservation management at a wide scale. We described geographic patterns of Montagu’s harrier diet across Eurasia, gathering diet data from 30 studies in 41 areas from 11 countries. We grouped prey as invertebrates, reptiles, small mammals, large mammals, eggs, small birds and large birds, and calculated the contribution of each prey type to the diet (as % biomass) and Shannon’s Diversity Index for each study site. We analysed qualitative estimates of prey abundance in relation to latitude and longitude, then diet composition in relation to habitat of the study area and prey abundance estimates. Diet diversity of Montagu’s harriers increased from north to south, while abundance of all prey groups other than small mammals showed the opposite trends. Agricultural areas in northern latitudes seemed to hold high densities of small mammals, but low densities of alternative prey. Overall, birds were the main prey in most of Montagu’s harrier’s distribution range, although the relative importance of each prey type in the diet was significantly explained by its local abundance and habitat, confirming the opportunistic foraging strategy of this raptor species. Consumption of mammals was an exception to this trend, being negatively associated with the abundance of alternative prey, suggesting that this prey is not preferred. Trophic diversity in this species could be influenced by land-use changes through variations in the abundance and availability of prey, which could impact its population dynamics. This may be particularly important for northern populations of Montagu’s harriers breeding in agricultural habitats, where trophic diversity is already low.",

		"abstract": "Urban agriculture is a unique form of agriculture that can provide fresh, local produce for urban residents, and may benefit biodiversity by decreasing the need to expand agriculture into natural areas as well as enhancing biodiversity in urban areas. However, although urban agriculture is also often cited as promoting biodiversity in urban areas, the extent of empirical evidence for such claims has not been studied. Here we systematically review the relationship between urban agriculture and biodiversity in the scientific literature. We strictly define urban agriculture as areas in cities that grow produce specifically for human consumption. We examined 148 papers from 2000 to 2017, of which only 24 studies fit our definition of urban agriculture, and of those, only 18 both involved urban agriculture and measured biodiversity. Of the studies that did measure biodiversity, some showed increases in diversity compared to urban vacant lots, but other showed no difference. Moreover, these studies were mostly focused on plants and invertebrates and were conducted almost exclusively in North America. In order to use the generalization that urban agriculture will have a positive influence on urban biodiversity, more studies will need to be conducted across a wider geographic range worldwide (particularly in developing countries in the tropics) and on a greater diversity of species and taxa (e.g., herpetiles, birds and small mammals). Such studies will likely increase in conservation importance as urban expansion and agricultural demands increase globally.",

		"abstract": "Strategies developed by organisms to maximize foraging efficiency have a strong influence on fitness. The way in which the range of food resources is exploited has served to classify species, populations and individuals from more specialist (narrow trophic niche) to more generalist (broad trophic niche). Recent studies have provided evidence that many of the considered generalist species/populations are actually composed of different specialist individuals (individual specialization). Even the existence of generalism as an adaptive strategy has been questioned. In this study, we investigated the relationship between trophic niche width, individual quality and offspring viability in a population of common kestrel Falco tinnunculus during 4 years. We showed that the diet of kestrels varied significantly among years and that individuals of better quality fed their offspring with a higher diversity of prey species and a higher amount of food. Moreover, body condition and immune response of nestlings were positively correlated with diversity of prey delivered by parents. Our study suggests that generalism has the potential to increase fitness and that broadening the trophic niche may be an adaptive strategy in unpredictable environments.",

		"abstract": "The winter ecology of the Northern Goshawk Accipiter gentilis was studied in northern Finland in 1991-95. The data consist of 26 radiomarked hawks, of which 331 day and 299 night positions were located. Average range size was 9894 ha for males (minimum convex polygon, n= 4) and 6282 ha for females (n= 11). Ranges calculated by the 75% harmonic mean contour gave range areas of 3283 ha for males (n= 3) and 2753 ha for females (n= 11). Harmonic mean centres concentrated near human settlements, implying better food availability there compared with woodland areas. Some Goshawks preyed upon animals living in the city dump in late winter. Goshawks preferred deciduous and mature conifer forests and avoided open areas such as fields and bogs. They also avoided very heterogeneous sites. The winter diet consisted mostly of Mountain Hares Lepus timidus (30.9%), Red Squirrels Sciurus vulgaris (23.6%), Brown Rats Rattus norvegicus (12.7%) and forest grouse Tetraonidae (27.1%), of which Black Grouse Tetrao tetrix was the most important (14.5%). By weight, hares constituted 70% of the biomass consumed.",

		"abstract": "The effects of forest fragmentation on bird populations have been studied primarily as static phenomena. Yet when forests are allowed to regenerate, local edge contrast and landscape matrix composition change with time, and we would expect fragmentation effects to change accordingly. Describing this process is critical for the conservation of avian species sensitive to forest fragmentation, including the Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus), a seabird threatened by ongoing harvest of old-growth forest nesting habitat. We experimentally assessed potential murrelet nest predation probability in four regions of southwestern British Columbia, Canada. We compared the fates of 448 simulated murrelet nests at paired edge and interior treatments, at sites with “hard” edges (recent clearcuts), “soft” edges (regenerating forest), and natural edges (i.e., riparian areas). Motion-sensitive digital nest cameras enabled us to focus on known predators of real nests, and patterns of nest fates did not differ between real and simulated nests. Using information-theoretic model selection (AIC) with the combined data set (116 sites), we assessed effects at patch (∼13 ha), landscape (∼1700 ha), and regional (∼96 000 ha) scales. Nest disturbance probability at hard edges was 2.5 times that of interior sites, but soft edges had less than half the disturbance probability of interiors. There was no edge effect at natural edges. At the landscape scale, overall avian disturbance risk declined by as much as 50% with increasing amounts of regenerating forest in the surrounding matrix. These results indicate that initially negative fragmentation effects decrease as forests regenerate, at both patch and landscape scales. There was no evidence that these patterns differed between regions. Predator surveys suggested that Steller's Jays drive patterns of nest predation risk at the regional scale. Assuming that corvids are the most important predators, larger reserves of habitat will lessen negative hard-edge effects. Smaller reserves should be embedded in a protective matrix of regenerating forest to reduce predation risk at both patch and landscape scales. Our results suggest that dynamic fragmentation effects are generalizable across widespread regions and can be broadly applied to both murrelet management and the conservation of old-growth forest-breeding birds in general.",

Here, we assess the importance of prey depletion as a driver of large carnivore endangerment globally using lists of prey species for each large carnivore compiled from the literature. We consider spatial variation in prey endangerment, changes in endangerment over time and the causes of prey depletion, finding considerable evidence that loss of prey base is a major and wide-ranging threat among large carnivore species. In particular, the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi), tiger (Panthera tigris), dhole (Cuon alpinus) and Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis) all have at least 40% of their prey classified as threatened on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and, along with the leopard (Panethra pardus), all of these species except the Ethiopian wolf have at least 50% of their prey classified as declining. Of the 494 prey species in our analysis, an average of just 6.9% of their ranges overlap protected areas. Together these results show the importance of a holistic approach to conservation that involves protecting both large carnivores directly and the prey upon which they depend.",

		"abstract": "With biodiversity facing threats, there is a need to improve reserve selection procedures. However, detailed information about different biodiversity measures (e.g. species richness) at potential sites is often lacking, and selecting areas that protect most biodiversity is difficult. To simplify matters, biodiversity surrogate species, that is, species associated with higher biodiversity than average, have been used for area selection. However, consensus about the performance of the surrogate species concept is lacking, and there are few studies investigating potential differences in the effectiveness of multiple predators as surrogates for biodiversity over large spatial scales. We evaluated two avian predators, the northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis and the Ural owl Strix uralensis, as surrogates for biodiversity in the boreal forest biome in Western Finland. We used a study design including nest sites and two reference sites for each nest, the diversity of birds and wood-decaying fungi (polypores). We assessed simultaneously whether surrogacy persisted at the landscape level while moving from one vegetation zone to another. We generally found more birds and polypores around the nest sites for both goshawks and Ural owls than at their respective reference sites. However, the goshawk outperformed the Ural owl. Additionally, although biodiversity was found to decrease at the landscape scale as a result of a decrease in vegetation complexity with increasing longitude, the surrogacy efficiency of the raptors remained unchanged. Synthesis and applications. These findings suggest that the surrogate species concept applied to raptors may be an efficient addition to methods for identifying areas of conservation priority, even across vegetation zones. We conclude that protecting areas around raptor nests is a method to consider in order to halt forest biodiversity loss. Finally, sampling biodiversity along diversity and landscape gradients can improve the necessary assessment of surrogate species.",
