	abstract = {[We studied prey populations and the use and composition of home ranges of 47 Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) over 12 mo in five landscapes in two forest types in southwestern Oregon. We measured 1-yr home ranges of 23 owl pairs, 2-yr home ranges of 13 pairs, and 3-yr home ranges of 3 pairs. The landscapes differed in the degree to which old forest had been fragmented by wildfire and logging. Prey populations were measured at 47 sites in southwestern Oregon. Further data on prey populations were gathered on 14 sites on the Olympic Peninsula in northern Washington, where owls use larger ranges than in Oregon. Owls in Washington used @?1700 ha of old forest annually and primarily one prey species; available prey biomass was 61 g/ha. Owls in Oregon Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests used 813 @+ 133 ha (X @+ SE) of old forest annually and concentrated on two prey species that had a combined biomass of 244 g/ha. Owls in Oregon mixed-conifer forest used 454 @+ 84 ha of old forest annually and three primary prey whose availability averaged 338 g/ha. The amount of old forest used by owls studied for 2 yr was 40\% greater in the 2nd yr than that used in the 1st yr. No increase in use of old forest was seen in the 3rd yr in Douglas-fir forest; 50\% more old forest was used in 3 yr than in the 1st yr in mixed-conifer forest. The most common prey in Washington and Oregon was the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus). In areas where the flying squirrel was the primary prey and where predation was intense (as judged by telemetry), flying squirrel populations were depressed. The addition of medium-sized mammal species, especially woodrats (Neotoma spp.), to the prey base appeared to reduce markedly the amount of old forest used for foraging. Owls traversed 85\% more Douglas-fir forest and 3 times more mixed-conifer forest in the heavily fragmented areas than in the lightly fragmented areas. Overlap among pairs and separation of birds within pairs in space increased with fragmentation. In the most heavily fragmented landscape, social structure appeared to be abnormal, as judged by the proportion of adult-subadult pairs, instances of adult nomadism, and overlap among the home ranges of pairs. The pattern of fragmentation affected the ability of owls to find concentrations of old forest in the landscapes. Even so, almost all the owls consistently selected old forests for foraging and roosting; only one owl selected a younger type as part of its foraging range. Selection of old forest was significant at three levels: landscape, annual home ranges of pairs, and foraging and roosting sites of individuals. The most important prey species, the northern flying squirrel, was twice as abundant in old forest as in young forest in all areas. Landscape indices (dominance, contagion, variance in density of old forest) had less predictive ability than indices based on owl home ranges because owls selected areas of concentrated old forest and because patterning was complex, reflecting four processes, each operating at a different scale: physiography, human land ownership (259-ha scale), history of catastrophic fires, and history of small-scale fires and timber harvesting.]},

	abstract = {Present forest conditions – loss of a herbaceous and shrubby understory,
reductions in the amount of older forests, and increased areas of dense tree
regeneration – reflect the extent of human influence on these forests. These
changes may also be affecting goshawk populations. Information on
goshawk nesting habitat and foraging behavior, and the food and habitats of
selected goshawk prey, was therefore synthesized to develop a set of
management objectives, desired forest conditions, and management
recommendations. Key objectives of the guidelines are to provide (1)
nesting, post-fledging, and foraging areas for goshawks, and (2) habitat to
support abundant populations of 14 primary goshawk prey. Thinning trees
in the understory, creating small openings in the forest, and prescribed fires
should help produce and maintain the desired forest conditions. Other
habitat elements critical for maintaining both goshawk and prey
populations include abundant snags and large downed logs, woody debris,
interspersion of different tree sizes across the landscape, and the majority of
a goshawk’s home range in older-aged forests. These guidelines should also
benefit forest health, soil productivity, and the habitats of other old-growthdependent
plants and animals.},

We applied these methods to 5 nests during each of the northern goshawk breeding seasons of 1998 and 1999 and identified 1,540 prey from deliveries, 209 prey from remains, and 209 prey from pellets. The proportions of birds and mammals varied among techniques, as did relative proportions of prey groups and age groups. Prey remains and pellets gave the least-similar diet descriptions. Over 2-day intervals during which data were collected using all 3 methods, prey-delivery data gave more individual prey and prey categories than the 2 other sources of information. We found that prey were not directly tracked in either prey remains or pellets compared with prey delivery videography. Analysis of prey-delivery videography provided the most complete description of diet, and we recommend that studies attempting to describe diet use this technique, at least as part of their methodology.},

	abstract = {During the 1990s, we conducted research on the distribution, productivity, and habitat relationships of Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) in eastern Oregon and Washington. Our research was initiated primarily in response to concerns raised about the status of Northern Goshawks in the western US, and coincided with early attempts to list the species as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act and the publication of management guidelines for goshawks in the southwestern US. To develop baseline information on the status, distribution, and habitat relationships of goshawks in eastside forests (i.e., east of the Cascade Mountain Range) in the Pacific Northwest, we established study areas on three national forests in eastern Oregon in 1992, adding a fourth study area in central Washington in 1994. We focused on the breeding season and nesting habitat because of its primary importance to goshawk ecology and the logistical feasibility of finding nests. Density of breeding pairs ranged from 0.03-0.09/100 ha, and annual productivity ranged from 0.3-2.2 young fledged/nest. Goshawks selected forest stands with trees of larger diameter and greater canopy closure for nesting than available in the landscape. Occasionally nests could be found in large trees in open-canopied stands. As distance increased from the nest site, forest type and structure became more heterogeneous and the prevalence of older-seral-stage forest declined. Dry or wet openings were present in most territories, often within close proximity to nest stands. Goshawks ate a variety of mammalian and avian prey. Mammal species made up a larger portion of prey biomass on two of the national forests, but avian species appeared to be more prevalent in the diet of goshawks in the most northern study area. We recommend that the existing management guidelines for goshawks in the Southwest form a basis for management in the inland Pacific Northwest, particularly with regard to nested spatial concepts, emphasis on management of prey, and the use of silviculture to promote the development and replacement of old growth or late-seral-stage forest. Our research and management recommendations can be used in concert with the Southwestern management guidelines to establish a mix of vegetation structural stages to support goshawk populations, their prey, and other forest wildlife species specifically for the inland Pacific Northwest.},

	abstract = {Diet studies present numerous methodological challenges. We evaluated the usefulness of
commercially available trail-cameras for analyzing the diet of Northern Goshawks (Accipiter
gentilis) as a model for nesting raptors during the period 2007–2011. We compared diet estimates
obtained by direct camera monitoring of 80 nests with four indirect analyses of prey
remains collected from the nests and surroundings (pellets, bones, feather-and-hair remains,
and feather-hair-and-bone remains combined). In addition, we evaluated the performance
of the trail-cameras and whether camera monitoring affected Goshawk behavior.
The sensitivity of each diet-analysis method depended on prey size and taxonomic group,
with no method providing unbiased estimates for all prey sizes and types. The cameras registered
the greatest number of prey items and were probably the least biased method for estimating
diet composition. Nevertheless this direct method yielded the largest proportion of
prey unidentified to species level, and it underestimated small prey. Our trail-camera system
was able to operate without maintenance for longer periods than what has been reported in
previous studies with other types of cameras. Initially Goshawks showed distrust toward the
cameras but they usually became habituated to its presence within 1–2 days. The habituation
period was shorter for breeding pairs that had previous experience with cameras. Using
trail-cameras to monitor prey provisioning to nests is an effective tool for studying the diet of
nesting raptors. However, the technique is limited by technical failures and difficulties in
identifying certain prey types. Our study also shows that cameras can alter adult Goshawk
behavior, an aspect that must be controlled to minimize potential negative impacts.},

Every two days (from hatching [late April] until juvenile dispersal [mid-October]) we visited control nest stands and provided food at treatment nest stands. We measured morphological characteristics and attached tarsal-mounted transmitters with mortality switches to 42 nestling Northern Goshawks when they were 21 days old. In both 1992 and 1993, we relocated birds via telemetry every other day until mid-August. We located birds at least once a week from mid-August until mid-October in 1992, and until late-November 1993. There were no significant differences in nestling size. Treatment birds had a significantly higher survival rate during the nestling period in 1993, but not in 1992. Because most control nestlings died from predation, we attribute higher nestling survival to increased time spent in nest stands by adult females, whose presence probably deterred predators.]},

	abstract = {Accurate knowledge of geographic ranges and genetic relationships among populations is important when managing a species or population of conservation concern. Along the western coast of Canada, a subspecies of the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis laingi) is legally designated as Threatened. The range and distinctness of this form, in comparison with the broadly distributed North American subspecies (Accipiter gentilis atricapillus), is unclear. Given this morphological uncertainty, we analyzed genomic relationships in thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms identified using genotyping-by-sequencing of high-quality genetic samples. Results revealed a genetically distinct population of northern goshawks on the archipelago of Haida Gwaii and subtle structuring among other North American sampling regions. We then developed genotyping assays for ten loci that are highly differentiated between the two main genetic clusters, allowing inclusion of hundreds of low-quality samples and confirming that the distinct genetic cluster is restricted to Haida Gwaii. As the laingi form was originally described as being based on Haida Gwaii (where the type specimen is from), further morphological analysis may result in this name being restricted to the Haida Gwaii genetic cluster. Regardless of taxonomic treatment, the distinct Haida Gwaii genetic cluster along with the small and declining population size of the Haida Gwaii population suggests a high risk of extinction of an ecologically and genetically distinct form of northern goshawk. Outside of Haida Gwaii, sampling regions along the coast of BC and southeast Alaska (often considered regions inhabited by laingi) show some subtle differentiation from other North American regions. These results will increase the effectiveness of conservation management of northern goshawks in northwestern North America. More broadly, other conservation-related studies of genetic variation may benefit from the two-step approach we employed that first surveys genomic variation using high-quality samples and then genotypes low-quality samples at particularly informative loci.},

	abstract = {[In long-lived raptors, research suggests that some nest areas consistently fledge more young than others, with the majority of young in the population being produced by a few females. If this claim were true for Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) populations, it would benefit land managers to identify high-quality goshawk breeding habitat. We examined whether the number of young fledged varied spatially among Northern Goshawk nest areas within three study areas where long-term reproductive data from goshawks were available: (1) Vancouver Island, British Columbia; (2) Jemez Mountains, New Mexico; and (3) Uinta Mountains, Utah. A mixed-model ANOVA indicated there was minimal spatial variation in nest productivity among nest areas within the three study locations. Rather, nest areas exhibited high temporal variability in nest productivity within each study area. These results suggest that temporal patterns such as local weather and fluctuating prey populations influenced Northern Goshawk reproduction more than spatial patterns such as habitat characteristics. Nest productivity may inadequately reflect spatial patterns in goshawk reproduction and so it would be premature to assume that habitat quality for Northern Goshawks was equal among nest areas within these study areas. Future research should examine spatial variability among nest areas in adult and juvenile survival rates to gain a complete picture of population responses to habitat change. /// Investigaciones en aves rapaces longevas sugieren que consistentemente más polluelos empluman en algunos sitios de anidación que en otros y que la mayoría de los juveniles en la población son producidos por unas pocas hembras.

En cambio, los sitios de anidación presentaron una alta variabilidad temporal en la productividad de los nidos dentro de cada área de estudio. Estos resultados sugieren que los patrones temporales como el clima y las fluctuaciones de las poblaciones de presas influencian la reproducción de A. gentilis más que los patrones espaciales como las características del hábitat. La productividad de los nidos puede reflejar inadecuadamente los patrones espaciales de la reproducción de A. gentilis, de modo que sería prematuro suponer que la calidad de hábitat fue igual entre los sitios de anidación dentro de las áreas de estudio.

(3) Diet diversity of each of the three raptor species expanded as the abundance of their main prey declined. Ground squirrels and birds were alternate prey for eagles; gopher snakes, kangaroo rats, and rabbits were alternate prey for red-tailed hawks. Prairie falcons had no single important alternate prey species. (4) Yearly frequencies of main prey in each of the three raptor diets were correlated with the annual abundance of that prey in the environment. Frequencies of alternate prey were correlated not with their own abundance but inversely with the abundance of the principal prey. (5) Eagle preference for jack rabbits was strong and unaffected by changes in prey densities. Red-tailed hawk selectivity for jack rabbits was inversely related to ground squirrel abundance, suggesting `switching' behaviour. Prairie falcon selectivity for ground squirrels did not vary with ground squirrel densities. (6) Prey choice was generally consistent with predictions of the original optimal diet model, but red-tailed hawk prey selection appeared to depend on relative prey densities.

The breeding-season diet of Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) includes both mammalian and avian species, varies geographically, and is often dependent upon tree squirrels of the genera Sciurus and Tamiasciurus. We studied alternative prey sources of Northern Goshawks in the South Hills of south-central Idaho, an area where tree squirrels are naturally absent and other prey frequently important in the diet of goshawks, such as smaller corvids, are uncommon. We quantified the diet of goshawks using nest cameras and surveyed abundance of prey using line transects. We found that goshawks consumed roughly 18.5\% birds and 78.7\% mammals by biomass, with diet dominated by the Belding's ground squirrel (Urocitellus beldingi, also known as Spermophilus beldingi; 74.8\% of total biomass consumed); however, the percentages of mammals and birds in the diet varied between years. The diet was low in diversity, with high overlap among nests, indicating a strong local dependence on the dominant food item. Lastly, the proportion of mammalian prey in the diet was greater in larger broods than in smaller broods. This study provides new insight into the adaptability of the goshawk, particularly in areas with unique prey assemblages.},

	abstract = {The U.S. Forest Service recently recommended managing forests to increase the abundance of prey for Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) in the southwestern United States. However, empirical data are needed to indicate whether goshawks select foraging habitat based on prey abundance, on the presence of forest structures that favor their hunting
strategy, or both. During the 1993 and 1994 breeding seasons, we indexed prey abundance and measured forest structure at sites used by radio-tagged goshawks and at nearby paired
sites that lacked evidence of goshawk use (contrast plots). Goshawks apparently did not select foraging sites based on prey abundance; indeed, abundances of some prey were lower
on used than on contrast plots. Goshawks selected foraging sites that had higher canopy closure (P 5 0.006), greater tree density (P 5 0.001), and greater density of trees .40.6
cm dbh (P , 0.0005) than on contrast plots. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that goshawk morphology and behavior are adapted for hunting in moderately dense, mature forests, and that prey availability (as determined by the occurrence of favorable vegetation
structure where prey are present above a low threshold) is more important than prey density in habitat selection. Nonetheless, current management recommendations for increasing prey
abundance also can create a forest structure more favorable for hunting by goshawks, particularly if stands are managed for canopy closure values above the prescribed minimum
level of 40\% canopy.},

	abstract = {Factors linked with intraspecific variation in trophic diversity are still poorly understood in generalist species like the Montagu’s harrier (Circus pygargus) but may have important implications for conservation management at a wide scale. We described geographic patterns of Montagu’s harrier diet across Eurasia, gathering diet data from 30 studies in 41 areas from 11 countries. We grouped prey as invertebrates, reptiles, small mammals, large mammals, eggs, small birds and large birds, and calculated the contribution of each prey type to the diet (as \% biomass) and Shannon’s Diversity Index for each study site. We analysed qualitative estimates of prey abundance in relation to latitude and longitude, then diet composition in relation to habitat of the study area and prey abundance estimates. Diet diversity of Montagu’s harriers increased from north to south, while abundance of all prey groups other than small mammals showed the opposite trends. Agricultural areas in northern latitudes seemed to hold high densities of small mammals, but low densities of alternative prey. Overall, birds were the main prey in most of Montagu’s harrier’s distribution range, although the relative importance of each prey type in the diet was significantly explained by its local abundance and habitat, confirming the opportunistic foraging strategy of this raptor species. Consumption of mammals was an exception to this trend, being negatively associated with the abundance of alternative prey, suggesting that this prey is not preferred. Trophic diversity in this species could be influenced by land-use changes through variations in the abundance and availability of prey, which could impact its population dynamics. This may be particularly important for northern populations of Montagu’s harriers breeding in agricultural habitats, where trophic diversity is already low.},

	abstract = {Developing comprehensive conservation strategies requires knowledge of factors influencing population growth and persistence. Although variable prey resources are often associated with fluctuations in raptor demographic parameters, the mechanisms of food limitation are poorly understood, especially for a generalist predator like the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis). To determine the reproductive responses of goshawks to variable prey populations, we evaluated 823 goshawk breeding opportunities on the Kaibab Plateau, Arizona, USA, during 1994–2002. Concurrently, density was estimated for 4 prey species (2 avian, 2 mammalian). We explored the relationship between goshawk reproduction and prey density at one temporal scale (year) and 2 spatial scales (study area, forest type). Prey density for all 4 species combined accounted for 89\% of the variation in goshawk reproduction within the entire study area (P {\textless} 0.001), 74\% in mixed conifer forest (P = 0.003) and 85\% in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest (P {\textless} 0.001). We found that an incremental increase in prey density resulted in a greater increase in goshawk reproduction in ponderosa pine forest than in mixed conifer forest, suggesting that the denser structural conditions of mixed conifer forest may have reduced prey availability. Red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) density explained more annual variation in goshawk reproduction within the study area (r2 = 0.87, P {\textless} 0.001), mixed conifer forest (r2 = 0.80, P = 0.001), and ponderosa pine forest (r2 = 0.85, P {\textless} 0.001) than did any other individual species. Although certain prey species were more strongly correlated with fluctuations in goshawk reproduction than were others, the high model selection uncertainty and the strong relationship between total prey density and number of goshawk fledglings produced indicated that alternate prey species were readily substituted for one another. Therefore, conservation strategies concerned with the status of goshawk populations should incorporate forest management practices that increase the abundance, diversity, and availability of prey resources.},

Our goals were to develop a protocol for installing motion-activated trail cameras at Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetas) nests to record diet information and productivity, and to estimate prey detection probability using different diet study methods. In 2014 and 2015, we installed cameras at 12 Golden Eagle nests with 18-42-d-old nestlings. Following installation, we monitored adult behavior using direct observation and post-installation image review. At two nests, adult eagles did not return to nests or exhibited behaviors suggesting avoidance of the cameras, but returned to the nests after cameras were removed. We visited the 10 remaining nests every 4 d to collect prey remains and pellets to generate prey-specific detection estimates for both images, and prey remains and pellets. Compared to inspection of prey remains and pellets, cameras recorded twice the number of prey (622 vs. 316), were more likely to detect the smallest and largest prey, and cost half as much. Cameras recorded productivity, fledging dates, and in one case, a nestling death. Trail cameras may be a reliable and cost-effective option to address clearly defined research goals and obtain required information about eagle behavior and nest contents. However, cameras should be used judiciously because installation creates a persistent manipulation at the nest. Camera appearance should be minimized, and post-installation monitoring that allows for timely responses to nest-avoidance behavior by adult eagles is important to prevent adverse effects on nesting success.},

	abstract = {Reliable and abundant resources are likely to favour specialization, while unpredictable environmental variation should favour a generalist strategy. The rodent population cycles of northern latitudes can be seen as both predictable and unpredictable, depending on the scale in time and space. The arctic fox Alopex lagopus is an opportunistic carnivore, but paradoxically, it seems to function as a specialist on fluctuating rodent Arvicolinae populations in most inland areas. We have studied the dietary response of arctic foxes in Sweden during 5 years of varying abundance of Norwegian lemming Lemmus lemmus, and how these changes influenced the reproductive success of the foxes. The arctic fox population on mainland Fennoscandia is threatened by extinction and the situation has deteriorated during the 1980s and 1990s because of an absence of lemming peaks. Our results showed that in all years, lemming was the main prey for arctic foxes, with 85\% frequency of occurrence in summer faeces (scats). Bird remains (mainly Passeriformes) were present in 34\% of the scats, reindeer Rangifer tarandus in 21\%, voles and shrews in 4\% and hares Lepus timidus in 2\% of the scats. The occurrences of lemming, bird and larger mammal (reindeer and hare) remains in the scats varied significantly between years. Temporal variations within summer seasons and dietary differences between sub-areas, indicated that arctic foxes fed opportunistically on the alternative prey types. Den occupancy rates were positively correlated with lemming population densities during the previous winter, indicating a strong numerical response. We conclude that from a functional aspect, the arctic fox in Sweden is a lemming specialist, since lemming is the main prey and their abundance is the best predictor of arctic fox reproductive success. Other prey are used opportunistically in relation to their availability.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Despite recovery plans, the Spanish Imperial Eagle (Aquila adalberti) and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) are in danger of extinction. These two flagship species tend to occur in pristine Mediterranean forests, and both prey preferentially on the rabbit (Oryctologus cuniculus). Spanish lynxes and eagles have sister species in continental Europe, the Eurasian lynx ( Lynx europaeus) and the Eastern Imperial Eagle (A. heliaca), respectively. Recent genetic evidence indicates that these two pairs of species started to diverge from their ancestor species slightly less than 1 million years ago, when the longest-lasting Pleistocene glaciations covered Europe. We hypothesize that the Iberian lynx and the Spanish Imperial Eagle emerged as separate species in the Pleistocene refugia of southern Spain, where they hunted yet another locally evolved species, the rabbit, on which they have become dependent for survival. Two large predators that emerged at the same time may go extinct simultaneously because of their inability to shift to alternative prey. Many other relict species, including numerous species from oceanic islands, have naturally small populations because of evolutionary constraints and are permanently threatened with extinction. Recovery plans aimed at putting these species out of danger are unrealistic, as their populations are and have been chronically scarce. We suggest that what these species need are maintenance plans designed to buffer population declines due to either stochastic or human-induced events. A metaphor for this would be “emergency care units” for conservation.},

	abstract = {The generalist predation hypothesis predicts that the functional responses of generalist predator species should be quicker than those of specialist predators and have a regulating effect on vole populations. New interpretations of their role in temperate ecosystems have, however, reactivated a debate suggesting generalist predators may have a destabilizing effect under certain conditions (e.g. landscape homogeneity, low prey diversity, temporary dominance of 1 prey species associated with a high degree of dietary specialization). We studied a rich predator community dominated by generalist carnivores (Martes spp., Vulpes vulpes, Felis catus) over a 6 yr period in farmland and woodland in France. The most frequent prey were small rodents (mostly Microtus arvalis, a grassland species, and Apodemus spp., a woodland species). Alternative prey were diverse and dominated by lagomorphs (Oryctolagus cuniculus, Lepus europeus). We detected a numerical response among specialist carnivores but not among generalist predators. The dietary responses of generalist predators were fairly complex and most often dependent on variation in density of at least 1 prey species. These results support the generalist predation hypothesis. We document a switch to alternative prey, an increase of diet diversity, and a decrease of diet overlap between small and medium-sized generalists during the low density phase of M. arvalis. In this ecosystem, the high density phases of small mammal species are synchronous and cause a temporary specializing of several generalist predator species. This rapid functional response may indicate the predominant role of generalists in low amplitude population cycles of voles observed in some temperate areas.},

	abstract = {Beginning with Emlen (1966) and MacArthur and Pianka (1966) and extending through the last ten years, several authors have sought to predict the foraging behavior of animals by means of mathematical models. These models are very similar,in that they all assume that the fitness of a foraging animal is a function of the efficiency of foraging measured in terms of some "currency" (Schoener, 1971) -usually energy- and that natural selection has resulted in animals that forage so as to maximize this fitness. As a result of these similarities, the models have become known as "optimal foraging models"; and the theory that embodies them, "optimal foraging theory." The situations to which optimal foraging theory has been applied, with the exception of a few recent studies, can be divided into the following four categories: (1) choice by an animal of which food types to eat (i.e., optimal diet); (2) choice of which patch type to feed in (i.e., optimal patch choice); (3) optimal allocation of time to different patches; and (4) optimal patterns and speed of movements. In this review we discuss each of these categories separately, dealing with both the theoretical developments and the data that permit tests of the predictions. The review is selective in the sense that we emphasize studies that either develop testable predictions or that attempt to test predictions in a precise quantitative manner. We also discuss what we see to be some of the future developments in the area of optimal foraging theory and how this theory can be related to other areas of biology. Our general conclusion is that the simple models so far formulated are supported are supported reasonably well by available data and that we are optimistic about the value both now and in the future of optimal foraging theory. We argue, however, that these simple models will requre much modification, espicially to deal with situations that either cannot easily be put into one or another of the above four categories or entail currencies more complicated that just energy.},

	abstract = {An understanding of the factors governing sciurid abundance in the Pacific Northwest is essential for prescribing forest management practices for second-growth forests where recovery of Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis) populations and enhancement of biodiversity are objectives. We compared results of companion studies of sciurids in western Washington and Oregon and examined patterns of abundance in relation to habitat elements on the Olympic Peninsula to elucidate governing factors and make recommendations for forest management. Regional contrasts show that Glaucomys sabrinus and Tamias townsendii in Douglas-fir forests in Oregon are 4 times more abundant than in western hemlock forests in Washington, and dietaries of Glaucomys, and the fungal communities that provide its food, are more diverse in Oregon than in Washington. Glaucomys sabrinus in old forests are 2 times more abundant than in young, managed forests without old-forest legacies (large live trees, large snags and large, decaying fallen trees); populations in young forests with old-forest legacies and with understory development may equal those in old growth. On the Olympic Peninsula, Glaucomys sabrinus abundance can be predicted by density of large snags and abundance of ericaceous shrubs. At least seven large snags/ha and well-distributed patches of dense shrubs (cover within patches {\textgreater}24\% and patches covering 40\% of the total area) are necessary for high densities of Glaucomys sabrinus. Abundance of Tamias townsendii reflects size of dominant tree and well-developed understories. Abundance of Tamiasciurus douglasii seems to reflect territoriality in concordance with food supply and was greatest where Glaucomys and Tamias were low in abundance. Patterns of abundance of the sciurids in old- and managed forests suggests that silvicultural manipulation of vegetation and creative snag or den-tree management could be used in a management strategy to accelerate the development of Spotted Owl habitat in areas where old growth is lacking.},

In Southeast Alaska, densities were the highest reported for the species, populations were not as closely linked to old-forest attributes, and individuals had a more diverse diet that was less dependent on mycophagy. Pacific Northwest communities are comprised of several arboreal rodents; Southeast Alaska has a depauperate mammal fauna. I hypothesized that Southeast Alaska populations had a broader realized niche because of competitive release. The red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) is the only other arboreal squirrel and it is absent from the southern outer islands of Southeast Alaska's Alexander Archipelago. I compared demography and body mass of G. sabrinus on Prince of Wales Island to a population in sympatry with T. hudsonicus on a separate island (Mitkof). Home ranges were larger and population density, breeding female density, and juvenile recruitment of G. sabrinus were all lower in sympatry with T. hudsonicus. In a companion study, G. sabrinus on Prince of Wales Island used cavities for denning relatively more frequently than in sympatry with T. hudsonicus on Mitkof Island. Female G. sabrinus depend on cavities for natal dens, and breeding female and population densities are positively correlated with large snag or tree density. The presence of T. hudsonicus may influence G. sabrinus populations by limiting availability of cavities. Furthermore, variation in vertebrate assemblages among islands may influence realized niches of resident species, which manifest unique demographic profiles compared to populations of different ecological communities.},

	abstract = {Compared to other birds, most raptors take large prey for their size, and feeding bouts are extended. However, ingestion rate has largely been overlooked as a constraint in raptors′ foraging and breeding ecology. We measured ingestion rate by offering avian and mammalian prey to eighteen wild raptors temporarily kept in captivity, representing seven species and three orders. Ingestion rate was higher for small than for large prey, higher for mammalian than for avian prey, higher for large than for small raptors, and higher for wide-gaped than for narrow-gaped raptors. Mammalian prey were ingested faster by raptors belonging to species with mainly mammals in their diet than by raptors with mainly birds in their diet, but the drop in ingestion rate with increasing prey size was more rapid for the former than for the latter. We argue that the separate sex roles found in raptors, i.e. the male hunting and the female feeding the young, is a solution of the conflict between the prolonged feeding bouts at the nest, and the benefit of rapid resumption of hunting in general, and rapid return to the previous capture site in particular (the prey size hypothesis). Thus, the sex roles differ more when prey takes longer to feed, i.e. from insects to mammals to birds. We then argue that the reversed sexual size dimorphism in raptors, i.e. smaller males than females, results from a conflict between the benefit of being small during breeding to capture the smallest items with the highest ingestion rate among these agile prey types (mammals and bird), and the benefit of being large outside the breeding season to ensure survival by being able to include large items in the diet when small items are scarce (the ingestion rate hypothesis). This hypothesis explains the observed variation in reversed sexual size dimorphism among raptors in relation to size and type of prey, i.e. increasing RSD from insects to mammals to birds as prey.},

	abstract = {Most raptors take large prey for their size compared to other birds, but tear the prey apart into small morsels before swallowing. Little is known about how the efficiency of this prey handling varies among raptors, and how it relates to their feeding niches, diets and gape dimensions. We offered 202 mammalian and 224 avian prey items to 37 wild raptors kept temporarily in captivity, representing ten species and three orders. Feeding efficiency was measured as the proportion of a prey item that was ingested. The proportion of a prey item ingested was larger for mammalian than for avian prey, declined with prey size, increased with raptor size, and was larger for typical vole feeders (with shorter and wider bills) than typical bird feeders (with longer and narrower bills). The proportion of a prey item ingested was not related to raptor sex when controlling for focal raptor body mass. The probability that the head of a prey was ingested was higher if the prey was a mammal than if it was a bird, whereas the opposite was the case for the entrails of a prey. The results suggest that the traditional use of prey remains to estimate raptor diets may lead to severe biases, the magnitude of which would depend on prey type and size, raptor sex, species and order, and raptor feeding niche. Failure to correct for uneaten remains of a prey would lead to overestimating the profitability of large prey, and in particular of large avian prey. The results are consistent with the idea that vole feeders can afford to have a well-developed digestive tract, and thus swallow prey in large pieces, because they pounce on prey from above. Bird feeders, however, must ingest food in smaller pieces because they have smaller guts as a result of selection to keep the body mass low to capture agile prey.},

In this study we compared the diet composition of the Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and the Buzzards (the Common Buzzard Buteo buteo and the Rough-legged Buzzard B. lagopus) in northern Finland obtained indirectly (by collection of prey remains and pellets) and by direct methods (using a movie camera and a video recording system). In order to investigate the relationship between these two types of diet data more generally, we combined our own material and some published original data. Video and film images allowed us to identify according to class or family level most of the prey items delivered to the nests during the surveillance sessions, but identification according to genus or species level often was difficult. We found that small prey items were underestimated in remains as compared to large prey items. However, when none of the prey delivered to the nest is in large numbers, prey remains give fairly reliable idea of the real diet.},

The data were analyzed by multiple correlation and stepwise multiple regression to determine the contribution of the variables to variation in the number of young fledged from one species to another in each locality. Variations in season length, clutch size, and breeding success were important components in variation in numbers of young fledged in Kansas, but length of nest cycle, being positively correlated with both clutch size and nest success, had the strongest correlation with the number of young fledged. In Arizona and Costa Rica, variation in breeding success held the key to predicting variation in number of young fledged, whereas in Ecuador season length and clutch size were the critical variables. The analyses suggest that data on production of young and the factors that cause production to vary from one species to another would add immensely to our understanding of the population ecology of birds.},
