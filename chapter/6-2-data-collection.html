<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Data Collection</h2>
<p>We assessed goshawk diet during the 2019 and 2020 breeding seasons through a combination of egested pellets, prey remains, and nest camera photos. Active goshawk nests were located as part of long-term population monitoring conducted by the British Columbia Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development (FLNRORD). For detailed survey methodology see <span class="citation">McClaren (2005)</span>. Some study sites contained active nests in both years of the study.</p>
<p>Prey remains and egested pellets were collected from 33 nests (2019 <em>n</em> = 18, 2020 <em>n</em> = 15). Pellets and remains were gathered from beneath active nests, from within nests after juveniles fledged, and from plucking-posts located within the site. Logistic constraints prevented more than one collection of pellets and remains at most sites, but some sites were visited multiple times during the breeding season. All prey remains and all pellets from a collection location (one nest or one plucking post) were combined into a single sample for each visit to that location.</p>
<p>Nest cameras were installed at a subset of these nests (2019 <em>n</em> = 6, 2020 <em>n</em> = 7) to record prey delivered to goshawk chicks. Nest cameras are an effective and relatively unbiased method of measuring avian diet <span class="citation">(Garc√≠a-Salgado et al. 2015 , Harrison et al. 2019)</span>. However, cameras may overestimate prey deliveries because goshawks cache prey items for redelivery to the nest at a later time, which creates a risk of double-counting items. Due to the discrete nature of our data we were unable to differentiate cached, re-delivered items from new items and did not attempt to account for caching in our analysis. We also did not attempt to differentiate between prey consumed by the female at the nest and prey consumed by the chicks.</p>
<p>Nest cameras were digital trail cameras (Reconyx brand, UltraFire and HyperFire models) mounted 2-5 meters distant from and slightly above the nest, usually in an adjacent tree. Cameras in 2019 were programmed to take three photos one second apart when triggered by motion, and an additional one photo every thirty minutes. Cameras in 2020 were programmed to take five photos one second apart when triggered by motion, and an additional one photo every twenty minutes. Installation took place during the early nestling phase (between 4 June and 18 July; mean installation date 21 June) and cameras were left in place until after juveniles dispersed in the fall. Camera site selection was not random but constrained by topography, site access, and timing of nest discovery. We observed no nest abandonment following camera installation.</p>
<p>Breeding chronology was not available for most sites. At 12 of the 13 nests with cameras (2019 <em>n</em> = 6, 2020 <em>n</em> = 6), chicks were aged from photos taken shortly after camera installation using a pictorial guide <span class="citation">(Boal 1994)</span>. Productivity was defined as the number of chicks to reach 32 days of age <span class="citation">(Boal 1994, McClaren et al. 2002)</span>.</p>
<!-- Steenhof & Kochert 1982 define fledging  success as number of young to reach 80% of the average age when young leave the nest. Boal 1994 states this is 32 days for NOGO, and this is the definition McClaren 2002 uses. -->
