***Q: How does landscape and diet affect NOGO occupancy and productivity?***

### 1: Obtain data
1. Use diet data from chapter one.
2. Use landscape data from chapter one.
3. Compile occupancy data...
    1. from South Coast
    2. from Vancouver Island
4. Obtain reproductive success from nest cameras.

### 2: BEC gradient
1. Examine variation in home range size, occupancy, and productivity across precipitation gradient.

### 3: Model reproductive success
1. Model landscape & diet as predictors of RS (occupancy & productivity).

## Outline

### Introduction
* NOGO as indicator/umbrella/whatever
    * Miller et al. 2014
* Diet -> population fluctuations (ie Yukon vs. Kaibab)
    * Salafsky et al. 2005 (intro)

### Methods

* Identification & counting of images/collections, biomass
    * Lewis et al. 2004
    * Rogers et al 2006
* Statistics (summary of items, comparisons)
    * Lewis et al. 2006

### Results
* Summary of deliveries, delivery rate
    * Rogers et al. 2006

### Conclusions
* Diet + landscape management implications (ie, Reynolds)
    * Rogers et al. 2006
* Diverse landscape -> diverse diet -> population stability
    * Salafsky et al. 2005

## Action Items
### Small items
* Finish data collection/identification methods
* ~~Think of logical groupings for prey items.~~
* Compile & revise diet data methods
* Compile occupancy data for diet nests
* Write "results" for summary of deliveries
* Run index of similarity
* ~~Run diversity index~~
* Change in total biomass, average item size, or mammal/bird ratio by chick age or brood size

### Big items
* Think of a logical way to categorize coastal-transition
