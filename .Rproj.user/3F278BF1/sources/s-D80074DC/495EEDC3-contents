Fantastic news is that I have finished processing all of my physical remains. So let's see what the final results are.

# For unidentified items, classify them by size and class.

  is.na(category) & class == 'Mammalia' & size == 'small' ~ 'small mammal',
  is.na(category) & class == 'Mammalia' & size == 'medium' ~ 'medium mammal',
  is.na(category) & class == 'Mammalia' & size == 'large' ~ 'large mammal',

There are a few odd cases to clear up:

* There are specimens from a site called Comsock that has no nest associated with it. Since there's no strong reason to suppose these are NOGO prey remains, I'll drop them.
* There are several NOGO remains, some of which may represent prey and some which may not. 
  * Item 1120 (MTF2019) was previously IDed as a SSHA, but after closer examination of the remains and the camera footage, is probably the chick that fell from the nest and not actually a prey item. So it should be dropped.
  * Item 1171 (GRC2020) looks to be a shed feather and not prey remains. (Although this nest def saw some cannibalism!) So it should be dropped.
  
```{r}
sc <- diet.items %>% filter(id != 1120) %>% 
  filter(id != 1171)
```

Let's start with some basic summaries.

```{r message=FALSE}
# Total number of items.
summarize(sc, n())

# Number of items per year.
sc %>% group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(n())

# Biomass per year.
sc %>% group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(sum(mass))

# Weird. Mean biomass of items for each year?
sc %>% group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(mean(mass))
```

So about the same number of things in both years, though slightly fewer and slightly heavier things in 2020 than 2019. Probs all those hare from PCR.

Let's look at the species list for each year.

```{r}
# For 2019.
sp.2019 <- sc %>% filter(year=='2019') %>% distinct (binomial) %>% arrange()
sp.2019

# For 2020.
sp.2020 <- sc %>% filter(year=='2020') %>% distinct (binomial) %>% arrange()
sp.2020

# Unique to 2019.
anti_join(sp.2019, sp.2020, by='binomial')

# Unique to 2020.
anti_join(sp.2020, sp.2019, by='binomial')
```

Let's see if there are any major differences between prey groups.

```{r}
# Add grouping variable.
by.group <- sc %>% mutate(group=case_when(
  class == 'Aves' & family == 'Phasianidae' ~ 'grouse',
  class == 'Aves' & family == 'Corvidae' ~ 'corvid',
  class == 'Aves' & family == 'Turdidae' ~ 'thrush',
  class == 'Aves' ~ 'bird',
  class == 'Mammalia' & genus == 'Tamiasciurus' ~ 'squirrel',
  class == 'Mammalia' & genus == 'Lepus' ~ 'hare',
  class == 'Mammalia' ~ 'mammal',
  TRUE ~ 'unknown'
))

# Make a frequency table.
freq.by.year <- by.group %>% group_by(year, group) %>% 
  mutate(count=n()) %>% 
  select(year, group, count) %>% 
  distinct() %>% ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from='group', values_from='count', values_fill=0) %>% 
  column_to_rownames(var='year')

# Run a chi-squared test for differences between years (is this even the right way to do it??)
chi.year <- chisq.test(freq.by.year, correct=FALSE, simulate.p.value=TRUE)

chi.year
```

Profoundly insignificant, which is great news.

That's enough comparisons, let's look at the final numbers for the total data. Start with the combined pellets + remains:

```{r}
by.group %>% 
  mutate(total.mass=sum(mass)) %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  mutate(group.mass=sum(mass),
         proportion.mass=group.mass/total.mass*100) %>% 
  distinct(group, group.mass, proportion.mass) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=group, y=proportion.mass, fill=group)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity', color='white') +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c(bird, corvid, grouse,
                             hare, mammal, squirrel,
                             thrush, unknown)) +
  labs(y='Proportion of biomass', 
       title='Prey items identified from combined pellets and remains') +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        legend.position='none')
```

A lot more grouse than seen here previously, because I finally got the knack of identifying grouse keelbones and went back through a lot of previously unidentified things and identified them.

And then pellets only:

```{r}
by.group %>% filter(source == 'P') %>% 
  mutate(total.mass=sum(mass)) %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  mutate(group.mass=sum(mass),
         proportion.mass=group.mass/total.mass*100) %>% 
  distinct(group, group.mass, proportion.mass) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=group, y=proportion.mass, fill=group)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity', color='white') +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c(bird, corvid, grouse,
                             hare, mammal, squirrel,
                             thrush, unknown)) +
  labs(y='Proportion of biomass', 
       title='Prey items identified from pellets') +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        legend.position='none')
```

Total species list:

```{r}
sc %>% distinct (binomial) %>% arrange()
```

It's pretty obvious here how my sp issue screws up everything. Voles are very distinctive, it doesn't make sense to classify them as "unidentified small mammal" when they're clearly a vole, especially because that makes my biomass calculation much sloppier. But because voles span multiple genera, it's impossible to classify them properly here, which screws up my richness/diversity calculations.
