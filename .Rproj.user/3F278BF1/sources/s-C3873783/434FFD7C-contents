> Taken together, these studies confirm the occurrence of the largest and smallest species in the diet is undersestimated by collecting prey remains. A compromist solution might be to combine remains and pelles (Simmons et al 1991) p151

> A similar situation exists on Haida Gwaii and Vancouver Island off the coast of Canada, which lack Snowshoe Hares (Doyle 2006)

> For prey that favours edge zones, woodland edge is an important hunting resource and individual hawks with most access to edge have teh smallest ranges (Kenward 1982). Where mature forest is the most important area for hunting, individual hawks with most access to old forest have the smallest ranges (Tornberg & Colpaert 2001).

(In Britain, NOGO spend a disproportionate amount of time in woodland, spent a disproportionate amount of time spend hunting in woodland, and were disproportionately successful in woodland. In Finland this same pattern held, but for woodland edges rather than open areas or deep forest. NOGO in Finland places ranges in areas with a disproportionate amount of edge and spent a disproportionate amount of time within edges.)
