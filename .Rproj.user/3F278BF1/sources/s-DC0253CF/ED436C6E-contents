This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Build sample.
my.plots <- data.frame(construct_buffer(coords=cam.sites.sf, shape='circle',
                                            size=r.hr.m, return_sp=FALSE))

# Make the graph.
bec.plot <- raster::as.data.frame(r.bec, xy=TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_raster(aes(x=x, y=y, fill=factor(bec_raster_SC_map_label)))

# Add sample polygons.
bec.plot +
  geom_polygon(data=my.plots, aes(x = my.plots[, 1],
                                  y = my.plots[, 2],
                                  group = my.plots[, 3]),
                                  col = "black", fill = NA)

# Can facet wrap polygons, but doesn't work with raster.
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data=my.plots, aes(x = my.plots[, 1],
                                  y = my.plots[, 2],
                                  group = my.plots[, 3]),
               col = "black", fill = NA) +
  facet_wrap(~my.plots[, 3], scales='free')
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
