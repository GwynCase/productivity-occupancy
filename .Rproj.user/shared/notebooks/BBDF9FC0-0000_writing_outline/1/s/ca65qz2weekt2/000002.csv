* Quantifying dietary niche breadth is necessary to understand population demographics and plan viable population sizes.

> Species conservation plans require a comprehensive understanding of the role each species plays in an ecosystem. This includes understanding the diet of each species and how fluctuations in food availability affect survival and reproduction. Furthermore, it is important to understand the flexibility a consumer may express relative to alternative prey sources. As a result, conservation and management plans for raptors have increasingly focused on prey availability in addition to habitat structure. -- Miller et al. 2014 (Introduction)
