* Different areas dominated by different forest types may be expected to have different prey base, with consequences for brood size and ultimately population growth.

> Our predictions are as follows: 1. There should be significant landscape-related differences in the goshawk diet, suggesting differences in the availability of prey. 2. The availability of certain prey types may affect the brood size of the goshawk, suggesting their particular importance among the total amount of suitable
prey. -- Solonen et al. 2019 (Introduction)
