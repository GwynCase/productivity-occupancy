* Diet may link to population fluctuation, with narrow diet leading to strong fluctuations (Yukon) and broad diet leading to low fluctuation (Kaibab). 

> The diversity of prey in their diets ultimately depends on the abundance and availability of the local bird and mammal fauna, which varies geographically. In Canada, although goshawks regularly consumed several prey species (->5), goshawk reproduction showed a strong functional response to only one species--snowshoe hare (Lepusa mericanus; Doyle and Smith 2001). In contrast, 14 species of birds and mammals regularly contributed to goshawk diets in the southwestern United States (Reynolds et al. 1992). This diet diversity may stabilize their breeding rates. --Salafsky et al. 2005 (introduction)
