* Recommendations for goshawk management include increasing prey abundance through forest management (Reynolds). This opens to the door to umbrella-style or ecosystem-based management, but that requires a thorough understanding of links between diet, prey, and landscape.

> Six nonexclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the requirement of spotted owls for old growth, but only abundance of prey can explain the requirement of Spotted Owls for large areas of old growth (Carey 1985). This hypothesis predicts that prey abun- dance (and diversity) and landscape composition should be the major correlates of home range size and the absolute amount of old growth in the range, that latitudinal variation in home range size should reflect prey distribution with changes in home range size being abrupt (reflecting abrupt changes in prey diversity), as opposed to clinal, and that selection of foraging habitat should reflect prey abundance. -- Carey et al. 1992 (Introdution)
